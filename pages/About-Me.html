                <p class="aboutText">First of all, thank you for coming to this page - I can only assume you're curious about me, or very lost! Much like Forrest Gump at a bus stop, I will tell you my story either way.<br><br>Much like Mr. Gump discovered one of his key skills (running) as a child, I realised early on that I have a bit of a passion for problem solving. I was very much an Art Attack addict when I was young, and I always got very excited at the start of the episodes where Neil Buchanan laid out what he was going to be making that week: he was setting up puzzles, and then he would show us all the solution. It felt like magic back then and it still has some of that magic today (Neil is now a full time artist, by the way, check out his stuff <a href="http://www.neilbuchanan.co.uk/">here</a>).<br><br>While I loved making crafty things back then, and I still do as you can see from my portfolio pages <a href="../pages/Portfolio-Home.html">here</a>, two things started to stand out as real 'puzzles' to me, real fascinations: videogames, and the most dangerous game of all, man. The games came first, and my earliest memory is actually recieving and playing the heck out of my first game, Pokemon Crystal on the GameBoy Color. This began a lifelong interest in technology as a whole, but especially how we create and interact with it. The Art Attack side of me loved the creative elements of it, and a growing interest in psychology led to the rest.<br><br>Now that the main parts of the recipe are in the bowl, you skip a few steps and you have me graduating university with a degree in psychology and an even deeper interest in usability, games, research methods, psychology as a whole, data, and, of course, problem solving. If you want to see how I indulge in these interests, take a look at my articles at this <a href="Articlepages/">link</a>. If you want to learn more about me (I'm blushing already), scroll down and see some of the other things that I love doing! Or click <a href="Contact-Page.html">here</a> to send me a message about how I need to ramble less in my About Me section...
                <div class="aboutImageCont"><img src="../Stuff/AboutMusic.svg" class="img-responsive midimage"></div>
                <p class="aboutText">I am a huge fan of music, and am apparently a fan of small, stringed instruments; I love playing the ukulele, I dabble in the ukulele bass (think small, acoustic bass; it's not weird, I promise), but my big love is for the strings section and I am currently enthusiastically learning to play the viola. The tone and challenge of the instrument is absolutely amazing, and it is a huge shame that it's so under-rated.</p>
                <div class="aboutImageCont"><img src="../Stuff/CodeIcon.svg" class="img-responsive midimage"></div>
                <p class="aboutText">Coding is an interest that started in university when I first became interested in music too. I wanted a way to make learning music theory a little more interactive when I couldn't touch an instrument, so I decided that making a little game would be the best way of doing it. It was... awful, and just involved being briefly shown a note on a staff and you had to dodge obstacles to touch one of three potential answers (to help improve not recognition at a glance). It was written in a game making program, but I felt limited by it so I started dabling in Python, Java, and C#, making the odd little game in each one but none of them clicking with me completely. I dicovered HTML, CSS, and Javascript more recently and I love them! MAyve it's how they interact, or maybe it's how every website can be borken down (-ish) into them, but it is a treat to code with them. I am making games and experimenting, and I even coded this whole website!</p>
                <div class="aboutImageCont"><img src="../Stuff/VGIcon.svg" class="img-responsive midimage"></div>
                <p class="aboutText">As I mentioned above, my love of videogames started young and quickly developed into enjoying everything around them. I read game magazines when I was young, follow the culture online now, actively make my own (that are gradually growing in complexity), I am working to be able to play the music from them, and, I'm even applying a deep interest in psychology to how we interact with and enjoy them. I don't really have a favourite genre, and I certainly couldn't tell you just one favourite, but I can trace a lot of my hobbies and interests back to them in some way!</p>
                <div class="aboutImageCont"><img src="../Stuff/CraftIcon.svg" class="img-responsive midimage"></div>
                <p class="aboutText">Speaking of other hobbies, I also have a long standing interest in craft in various forms. When I was young, I was making furniture and go-karts out of wood and metal, but I slowly moved away from this as getting materials became more annoying than the craft (kids have very limited wood funds). I moved onto designing and building other little things, enjoying the cause and effect relationship of various projects. You can see the results of a lot of that stuff in my film work, which you can see in my portfolio <a href="Portfolio-Home.html">here</a>. It's also why I had a lot of satisfaction in fixing up a typewriter for <a href="Portfoliopages/IAGASU-Page.html">IAGASU</a>, it's why I love the cause and effect element of coding, and it's why I'm looking into starting a few RaspberryPi projects when I get a little more time. It all comes down to problem solving though, and it probably always will!</p>
