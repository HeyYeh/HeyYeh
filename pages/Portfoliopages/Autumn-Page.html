                <h2>Behind the stitch:</h2>
                <p class="filmtext">This is my favourite thing that I have stitched, and it was a huge commitment from the very start; both making the pattern and actually stitching it took well over 250 hours of my life, but they were relaxing, fulfilling hours! This was based on one of my favourite paintings, unsurprisingly titled ‘The Loneliness of Autumn’ by Leonid Afremov, and was painted on canvas using a pallette knife. Yep, that thing that you ice cakes with/use to shift pizzas off of a baking tray straight out of the oven because it was the first thing you could grab in the drawer. It was the colours that drew me to this painting, and it gives this real sense of reflection and calmness - a lot of his work is like this too, and you can (and should) have a look at more of it <a href="https://afremov.com/">here</a>! This was one of the first things I ever stitched, and there are some rookie mistakes in both designing and stitching it that I learned from: one of which is the fact that I used <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> and some of the less featureful cross stitch pattern makers out there, so it was more aggravating and time consuming than it should have been.<br><br>One of the reasons that I chose this piece was, naively, because I thought that making a pattern from it would be relatively easy. It has big blocks of colour after all, so surely that will just be a bunch of colour blobs in the pattern too, right? Well… Yeah, but also, God no. While parts of the painting are blobs of colour that I could just shape as I needed to, most of the painting is amazing because of how the colours blend and dance together, not to mention the surprising detail in stuff like the bench. To get a sense of shape out of the project, it came down to playing with colour over adding clear outlines, or backstitching, and that meant a long, difficult drawing process. Despite the rookie mistakes though, I am happy with how it turned out - part of me wants to delve into a huge project again too, but another part of me is mildly terrified of the idea…</p>
