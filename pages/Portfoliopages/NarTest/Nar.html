<!-- To-Do list: 
      1) Add Pyor stuff - Pyor intro stuff is there, the other deck needs adding
      2) Death - sorting out graveyard scoring object system
      3) Adding character name options - low priority
      4) Sanity - low sanity stuff needs to happen

                <h2>Behind the game:</h2>
            	<p class="filmtext">This is a project that I was working on for a little bit that sadly fell off in terms of my priorities and so is the tiniest bit dead. It happens with projects sometimes and, while it is sad, it doesn't mean that it is worthless. Finishing projects is not the only way to learn, especially when you might have bitten off more than you can chew (*cough*whoops*cough*)<br><br>This is a narrative based game inspired by swipe mechanics in a lot of apps these days, the most well known probably being Tinder. Ironically though, adding touch screen capability was pretty low on my to-do list, and so if you're on this page on a puny screen there is every chance that the game is unplayable. Sorry about that.<br><br>If you can actually play it, you can see that it is also a resource management game where you play as the CEO of a large company who, for their own reasons, has become deeply interested in higher beings. The catch is that your character can die in their pursuit of this, at which point you play as their ancestor as they pick up the pieces and continue your work. It's based on the works of H P Lovecraft, so it's inherently weird and gothic - a fun style to write in!<br><br>There is currently only one Higher One in the game right now, but my design doc for this had many more in the works. I was also going to take the step to creating original art for the characters but, as this project is on the backburner for a while, these various classic portraits will do fine.<br><br>As I said, this was an intense learning process. There are a lot of moving parts to it for a HTML canvas game, and this was very much an experiment in narrative design that became a larger coding project than I first thought. Still, it was a lot of fun and I would be more than happy to talk about the planned features, implemented features, the tools that I made to make coding it quicker, and even the sheer weirdness of the Higher Ones that I had planned (God, I love world building).</p>
