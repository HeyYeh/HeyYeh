                <p class="filmtext">
                    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">My overall process for pitching projects varied based on a lot of factors, from my own reaction to the brief that I'm given to the client's own wants and needs. This is unsurprising obviously, but it does make presenting a standard methodology difficult. Below I will</p>

                <h4><b>Visual design or, more specifically, the things you click
</b></h4>
                
                <p class="filmtext">Before I start, I should say that I would love to talk about the sheer artistry in the visual design of this game. Seriously, a lot of love has gone into it, from as nitty gritty a praise as the color pallette, to the broad admiration of the beautiful animations throughout the game. While these things do have merit from a psychology perspective too, creating that sense of immersion (or ‘presence’, as the literature prefers to call it) that pulls you in and creates a fluid experience, I want to talk about the user interface a little more first. <br><br>You see, creating a menu or a HUD <i>seems</i> incredibly easy to a naive designer. It’s just text right? You can just list all of the options and it’ll be fine… Right? Well, no. There is an awful lot of nuance to menus in videogames in particular, finding that balance of usability and clarity and sometimes making the decision to work around them altogether. More importantly though, menus and the HUD are brilliant from a psychology perspective because they use pretty much every human information processing technique that we have: visual scan and searching, reading and comprehension, judgement and decision making, response selection, problem solving (Norman, 1991), and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. If you’re a designer, you have to then be conscious of all of the ways that you can screw up: visual crowding, cognitive load, Hick’s law (decision making time linearly increases as options increase), to name just a few big hitters. DmC performs this beautifully, and there’s a lot to learn from both the menus and the HUD more broadly.<br><br>We actually get an interesting perspective into the creation of these elements that you don’t usually get in AAA games like this: Ninja Theory brought in a design team (AtomHawk) to tackle these parts of the game and they wrote a brief, but interesting post about it (find it <a href="http://atomhawk.com/case-study/devil-may-cry">here</a>). For the main menus, NinjaTheory don’t seem to have gone with AtomHawk’s design (see their design and the final product in Figure 1), but they do hint at how the video game production process may have caused this too. See, the initial designs were a lot more detailed and involved a lot of geometry, even rendering items in an in-menu shop system, and this would have taken a long time to put together, time that NinjaTheory or Capcom couldn’t justify. AtomHawk simplified their design, but it was still at a point that would have needed rendering and artist time that they couldn’t commit. The final Dante image in the menu they went with is taken from a scene in the main game, likely created months before, and… Well, it fits the palette and style nicely. Better still, it works very well from a user standpoint, and let’s explore why.</p>
                    
                <div class="articlefiller"></div>
                    <img class="img-responsive articlesubimage" src="../../Stuff/ArticleImages/DmCFigure1Menus.png" />
                <p class="filmtext"><i>Figure 1 - AtomHawks’s background design (left), compared to the final design (right)</i></p>
                <div class="articlefiller"></div>
                    
                   <p class="filmtext"> In terms of general layout and appearance, the menus are fairly minimalist. You have large text options in a fitting font that lead to similarly designed screens, which in itself is a merit worth mentioning. DmC follows the ideal ‘flat-navigation’ structure, which just means that anything you might want is accessible within two to three clicks. This is very important because good menu layout should rely on recognition of items (immediately knowing what they do or what sub-options they’ll include) rather than assuming the player will just remember what and where their desired options are (Budiu, 2014), and DmC achieves this with excellent information architecture. The main menu options are divided into just a few clear categories (reducing cognitive load through visual search and comprehension), AND when you start the game you are already selecting the option that will get you into the action the fastest (e.g. ‘Continue’ - this is common practice and something you don’t even notice until a game doesn’t do it and it becomes incredibly frustrating). This matches the fast pace that players of the series will expect and enjoy most, and shows how suited to its audience DmC is.<br><br>The designers also had their ideal users, newcomers to the series, in mind when creating the difficulty screen. The Devil May Cry main series is infamous for it’s inherent difficulty, and the sheer number of difficulty options, all with slight tweaks. ‘Dante Must Die’, for example, is a staple of the series but isn’t just the same ‘enemies hit harder’ deal that a newcomer might expect. These options are explained clearly at the bottom of the screen in a bright white that is very visible regardless of distance from the option selected, and even explains what you should expect from the difficulty level and who it might be suitable for (as you can see in Figure 1). Difficulty is also restricted to what is essentially easy, medium, and hard at the start too, offering these further difficulties as actual rewards. This helps with the decision making of a difficulty (it would be a lot more annoying to choose one if you had all of these options at the start), but is also just a natural design feature of the series.<br><br>Admittedly, praise for the game menu is all a little… generic. You assume that the menu will have these features because they make your life easier and lead to a pleasant experience, but that’s pretty much what good design is. You don’t notice it until it isn’t there, and then it’s all that you notice. Similarly, the HUD is deserving of some brilliant praise… So I’m going to give it some...</p>
                
                <h4><b>Heads-Up-Dante</b></h4>
                
                <p class="filmtext">The heads up display was also designed by AtomTheory and this design made it into the final product. They state that the broad look was inspired by graffiti artists like Banksy, fitting the overall feel of the game, and they do look good, and not just because of the cool graphics. First off, using slightly opaque white as their primary colour was a great idea because the main colour palette of the game rarely uses large amounts of white, meaning your health and weapons (important things to be able to glance at) are constantly easily visible. The overall HUD elements are all small, fitting the game well because your eyes are going to be seated in the centre-ish of the screen pretty much the whole time - your health is always visible at a quick glance, but you have so much more screen space to see those sweet, sweet animations. Another factor that helps with that cutting edge glance technology is the lack of visual crowding: HUD elements are spaced out, often to different corners, and the only two bars that are close together are your health and devil trigger bars. Even then though, the devil trigger bar isn’t even visible until a few missions in when you have already become expert at glancing at your health bar (and we know expertise counteracts visual crowding effects; Wong, & Gauthier 2012) AND it doesn’t share visual characteristics like size or colour making it easily discernible.

                <p class="filmtext">The real star of the show though? The style indicator, without a doubt. This is what tells you how well you’re doing and is interesting from both a gameplay and visual design perspective. To get gameplay out of the way quickly, it encourages players to use a variety of moves to make their points increase, stopping people spamming one move that’s effective and then reinforcing this behaviour through the end-level screens that actually give you nice grades and level-up points for getting high Style marks. This system has been in every Devil May Cry game, but it’s notable in its gameplay effects here because of how much easier it is to get high style grades in DmC; the game was built to attract newcomers to the series and feeling like you’re doing well is a great reason to stick with a game. This, naturally, was a big point of anger for long-time fans and was fixed a little bit in the later released ‘Definitive Edition’. Say what you will though, feeling like you’re doing well (‘competence’, in the literature) is a big source of satisfaction (Richard, Rigby, & Przybylski, 2006; Rigby, & Ryan, 2011; and many others). Maybe long-term fans held a sort of social-comparison mastery where their skill at previous games made this new, easier system feel cheap for being inclusive, but there just isn’t much research on this in terms of video games just yet. There’s a fair bit on academia, but that is a whole other beast…<br><br>Anyway, visual stuff: the style indicator both draws your attention, and doesn’t even need to try and draw your attention at the same time. When your style level increases, your grade flashes increasingly bigger the better you’re doing, a black splotch appears in the background (changing shape info to draw attention from periphery), an announcer actually shouts your grade in increasingly intense/satisfying tones, the music grows more intense the higher the style grade, and, and this is my favourite part, you get a little bit faster at the higher ranks encouraging you to do more impressive combos. Regardless of whether you think the base game’s style system is too easy or not, it succeeds brilliantly in letting you know that it’s there: it makes it very easy to glance at so that your eyes can return to the action but, for the most part, you don’t even need to glance. The sound cues are both clear and satisfying, the system blends into the overall design so perfectly that it doesn’t grow annoying, and the very feel of the game changes slightly, but not in a jarring way, the better you do. This is how you create a great combo system through multi-sensory design, something that videogames as a medium can be amazing at, though it is difficult to balance (Dinh, et al., 1999; Chang, & Nesbitt, 2005).<br><br>Phew! Those were some long sentences! And this is just a taster of what I could go into, but I should probably actually talk about gameplay at some point too…

                <h4><b>This game also has gameplay</b></h4>
                
                <p class="filmtext">I will try to be a little less in-depth for this section to avoid this going on endlessly, but I will equally try not to hold back any enthusiasm. For example, the levelling up system used in this game is brilliantly fitting to both the feel of the game, and to the audience that the game is directed at. After each mission (note I resisted gushing about the end mission screens) you get points based on various factors like style and collectibles gathered and these translate into level-up points depending on how well you do. You then spend these level up points on various moves that you can, in-turn, use to cut, smash, and shoot your way forward. Here’s the key thing though: these points are entirely interchangeable at any time out of mission, so you can toy around with your active skills whenever you want. Unlike more RPG heavy systems like that of Borderlands or The Witcher, you are free and flexible to explore with the only limit being your total skill points. That is a crucial limit though, because it parallels the linear growth of the player: new players won’t be overloaded with moves because they just can’t afford many, mid-level players will actually learn the new skills they use rather than use one or two effective ones for each weapon, and higher level players will have actually internalised a variety of moves to help them get those high style grades. The freedom is great for player experience, but is also a brilliant tool to avoid information overload and encourage players to actually use all of the moves that are put into the game - a problem that other action games (Darksiders, for instance) struggle to work around. See? Minimal gushing.<br><br>Speaking of reducing cognitive load though (which is pretty much what we’re always speaking about), the very feel of combat itself is subtly influenced by input buffering. This is common terminology in some fighting game series, as well as some other action games, where you can ‘queue’ an attack by pressing a button before the current attack animation is actually finished. This makes the gameplay have a little more flow to it, and makes it significantly more accessible to newcomers to this kind of game, a key demographic as I may have mentioned. When it comes to input buffering though, there is a fine balance to it: pretty much every modern game with combos uses it to some degree but the window where the buffer is available can either be so small that input timing can be measured in single frames, or so big that combat feels very trivial and mashy. While I can’t speak about frame data in DmC (but ohhhh how I wish I could), I personally feel that the balance is just right, offering a low barrier of entry for creating cool looking combos, while maintaining a high ceiling of skill as the loading screens and various combo videos on YouTube will show you.<br><br>The input buffering thing is one small part of Ninja Theory’s efforts to streamline the feel of combat here in general, which is one of the big things that reviewers of the game pick out. Rather than the relatively clunky weapon switching and stance changing of previous games, you can access one of your angel weapons and one of your demon weapons at any time by holding a trigger. The stances were gone altogether, which did meet a lot of criticism, but I wouldn’t say that it detracts too much. I love royal guard as much as the next guy, but it has its place in the other games in the series, and would have added a whole level of fog to the mechanics of this game. By making weapon transitions easier, players feel more immersed more quickly, not having to adjust their brains to an unusual or clunky set of inputs. </p>

                <p class="filmtext"><i>Streamlined controls also make these platforming sections much more fluid</i></p>
                <div class="articlefiller"></div>
                
                <p class="filmtext">While we are discussing good gameplay intentions meeting criticism, I guess I should bring up the lock-on issue? In the initial release of the game, there was no lock-on button which had been a staple of the series in pretty much every game so far. In its place was a sort of auto lock-on where player attacks were drawn to enemies a little more naturally, but long term fans felt like some of the control was being taken away from them through doing that. There really is no right answer to this debate though; Ninja Theory were aiming to reduce cognitive load and bloated button layouts for new players, and long term fans missed the satisfying levels of skill required to excel at the game. In the remaster, an optional lock-on system was reintroduced, so I guess we got the best of both worlds in the end?<br><br>Ninja Theory also introduced a mechanic where enemies would become inactive when the camera wasn’t looking at them, which made large fight scenes a bit less chaotic. This is a trick used in a lot of modern action brawlers, but stands out a little in DmC because… Well, because it’s used heavily here. As a player, this was something I noticed (*cough*and abused*cough*) early on in the campaign, rotating the camera to isolate some enemies knowing that I was perfectly safe to do so. I have seen zero criticism of this from other people, but it stands out to me as a slightly jarring feature. If enemies were slowed dramatically instead of stopped altogether, it might feel a bit more natural, but as is it does take me out of regular combat and turn it into a camera based puzzle game at times. Even great things have flaws though, and, at the end of the day, this is a feature with its heart in the right place and the players in mind.</p>
                
                <h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
                
                <p class="filmtext">That’s the real gist of what I’m getting at throughout this entire article: DmC’s designers had the players in mind the <i>whole</i> time. Not just ‘players’ in general though, the players that they expected to get (long term fans of the series and gameplay), and the players that they wanted to get (newcomers to the series and/or genre) and they effectively worked towards a middle ground of the two. They used best-practices to do this, sure, but they also took approaches that changed fundamental aspects of the series and improved upon them by thinking about what would be more accessible, more natural, and, most importantly, more fun. DmC: Devil May Cry is a well designed game, and is deserving of many, many levels of praise.</p>
