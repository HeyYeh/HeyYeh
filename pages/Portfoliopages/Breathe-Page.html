                <h2>Behind the video:</h2>
            	<p class="filmtext">This was, as is a theme in the work I've done, kind of a crazy shoot too. A very fun one, with a fantastic band, but crazy nonetheless! A lot of the insanity here came from two main sources: working with smoke, which I will talk about below, and the actual location. We sourced a completely abandoned upper section of a Wetherspoons, which used to be a cinema but had been untouched for years. This meant a lot of freedom for my practical effects and for general set building, but it also meant that a good layer of dust was everywhere. Everywhere. It was all very much worth it though, and the location and freedom that it allowed us meant that we could create a video with some very pretty effects, as well as an underlying meaning to tie it all together.</p>
            	<h2>So it has a meaning then?</h2>
            	<p class="filmtext">Oh it does, and it's heavily symbolic! The song itself is actually about a break up where there are still a lot of confusing feelings and ambiguous attitudes towards each other. Neither person knows what the other is feeling or how to act, leaving them both in a desolate no manâ€™s land of post-relationship turmoil. For the girl, that relationship was the first that really made her feel wanted, that stayed longer than any other, and she struggled with that and pushed it away. Maybe she was scared he'd leave her like the men in her past, maybe a part of her really was unhappy... Either way, the video is from the perspective of the man, part of him longing for this girl that is clouded in uncertainty, and part of him just wanting to move on...</p>
         	   <h2>So what did you do in this one?</h2>
            	<p class="filmtext">The standard old producer things were the bread and butter of pre-production; sourcing props, planning the set-up day, sourcing locations, balancing budgets, speaking to the entire crew, and preparing for practical effects, and then there was a lot of set management during the shoor. The effects in this one were a valuable learning experience too, and had a lot of challenges that were interesting to work through.<br><br><b>The wonderful world of smoke</b> - Smoke is a fickle beast to work with, to put it in polite terms. First of all, its behaviour is incredibly dependant on the room that it's in. For example, setting up and planning effects in a normal sized living room involves smoke acting very different to doing the exact same effect in the main theatre of an abandoned cinema. Second, smoke (much like me) really likes to be cold. The colder the smoke is, the denser it appears on camera, and the problem there? It needs to be <i>especially</i> cold when you're working with it in a large room, which we were. This meant that I had to run the smoke through some pipes (which we were doing anyway to direct and contain it), and these pipes were wound into two coils with each coil sitting in a bucket of ice water. I had someone regularly getting ice to keep these pipes cold, which did the trick, but it took some very quick problem solving to do so.<br><br>There are a couple other tricks and effects that I had a hand in for this one too, but I kind of don't want to spill all of the beans on how they were done. Feel free to watch and enjoy them though, I imagine you'll be able to work out the methods without my rambling!</p>
