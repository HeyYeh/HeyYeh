        <h2>Behind the game:</h2>
        <p class="filmtext">This was the very first thing I made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and was actually what made me fall in love with these languages. Before this, I had a made a few odd, very simple games in C# and Java, but neither language really clicked with me. I moved on to these languages on a whim, wanting to experiment and broaden my horizons, and here I am!<br><br>My initial thoughts on this were to create a game that actively displays how low your odds of winning the lottery actually are (based on the UK lottery, at least). To do this, there were some very important features that I wanted to include: a money counter that shows you how much you lose in regularly playing, a manual 'Lotto' button to give you that sense of control and really drive home the message that this is how it really works, an 'Auto Lotto' button to simulate a really long time period quickly to display those low odds in a tangible way, and an actual week counter so that understanding the time and money invested is much easier.<br><br>Okay, I admit that the psychology here is what really appealed to me at first, and I did have some minor lofty hopes that this could help ease some people out of a lottery habit or a scratchcard habit (and I may make a special scratchcard version one day too). I kept this goal in mind the whole time, however lofty it was, but this project was starting to inspire the problem solver in me too. I was having to constantly learn and adapt to using new methods, and I constantly asked people to try the simple game to see where I could improve it. In my initial test, there was no limit on choosing numbers higher than 51 or lower than 1, meaning it was impossible to win. I fixed this, then another test highlighted that people can still choose the same number six times and raise their odds of winning big from 1 in 13,983,816, to the much more palatable 1 in 59. Another test showed that changing numbers halfway through would not stop the simulation, which takes away from the realism (reducing any potential psychological effect it might ever have), and another test displayed that only counting time in weeks still makes it hard to fathom how long it takes to make any kind of progress - the time is now measured in weeks and years after week 52, and these other issues were gradually fixed as well.<br><br>For my first project, I'm pretty proud of it! Sure, it may not be particularly optimised or perfectly coded, but the first step to being kinda good at something is being pretty damn bad at it, and, if nothing else at all, this was a fun and valuable learning experience.</p>
