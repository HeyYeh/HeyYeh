                <h1>How copy and UX writing really gets into your brain</h1>
                <h3>or, a brief overview of the techniques of copy and UX writers, and how they influence us psychologically</h3>

                <p class="filmtext">
                    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">We are living in a time when companies want to express themselves as individuals more than ever, and it is becoming key to their presence in the digital world. They can communicate directly to the masses through social media, after all, and they have one account and one voice to do it. Just look at the American food chain Wendy’s, who the internet have been talking about on-and-off for their casual, witty, and often hilariously mean tweets -- tweets that you wouldn’t expect from a burger chain, but a person. The dark truth here is that, yes, an individual person is likely writing all of these posts, but they are far from writing them in a vacuum. In most cases, written and visual company identity is the result of a swimming pool of market research, conversations between art directors through to copywriters, and sometimes, as seems to be the case with Wendy’s, an off handed tweet that flings the company into the spotlight and therefore creates that <a href="https://splinternews.com/that-time-i-went-viral-while-running-the-wendy-s-twitte-1819001087">brand identity in a flash.</a></p><br>

                    <p class="filmtext">The research is the key part of that, in my opinion, because it establishes the exact people that you are trying to connect with. Appealing to one demographic, the one that cares about your product the most, makes a huge amount of sense too because that naturally transfers to more sales. This is, contrary to that sales focused approach, not what pure capitalism is though; this isn’t one company having a better product per se, it’s one company connecting with people more deeply through the work of creatives. I have a huge soft spot for this on both the creative side and, shock horror, the psychological side, and I want to explore this in depth by focusing on written communication specifically. What methods do copywriters and UX writers use to actually appeal to one audience? And what on a psychological level might actually motivate people to ‘connect’ with a brand off of that?<br><br>All this and more… Now!</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive articlesubimage" src="https://i.redditmedia.com/_NwRhjGLzF5nTd7UFZKkT-VLSQm6E6taYebztAI0EHI.jpg?w=1024&s=5a76c8d1af03000f9066954aba92e2a9" />
                    <div class="articlefiller"></div>

                    <h4><b>How do they do it?</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">Let me start this section off by highlighting a couple of things: first of all, copywriters come in oh so many shapes and sizes. You have your content writers, social media writers, marketing writers (who lean towards email and advertising most of the time), SEO specialists, pitch writers, and many more on top of that with blurred lines between them. UX writers, to add further confusion, could be considered ‘digital copywriters’ if you wanted to annoy one - their role is fine tuning language on websites and apps (sometimes packaging too) to both help the audience interact with the product seamlessly and to generally make it a pleasant, engaging experience. The common theme between them, and why I feel okay casting a wide net with my explanations here, is that they all speak with the ‘brand voice’. Every one of these roles uses language for a different goal, but they have to be speaking as if one entity, the company, was saying it.<br><br>Let’s break language down a little further then and explore the ways that a ‘brand voice’ is actually made.<br><br><u>Tone</u><br><br>Tone is the word that will follow every aspect of your life as a copywriter, and is undeniably integral to the role. The tone that you write in covers pretty much everything about what you’re writing, from when to use and break grammar rules, to whether you pop an emoji in your sentence, to the very language that you use. This might mean using informal contractions (“haven’t”, “you’ll”, etc.) over the more formal long-form writing (“have not”, “you will”, etc.), or it might mean writing in short, blunt sentences, as if you’re expressing some kind of universal fact. This, by the way, is often how politicians speak, and creates a sense of authority in them and trust for the message in the audience, but political rhetoric is besides the point.<br><br>Let’s look at these two sentences to help us explore tone:</p>


                    <blockquote><i>“Try Elmer’s Honey to start your day off sweet.”<br><br>“Elmer’s Honey is a natural product of bees and works well with many breakfast foods.”</i>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p class="filmtext">They both have the same goal, they both want you to buy a product, but their tone is vastly different. The top sentence has a sing song-y sibilance (melodic ‘s’ sounds for emphasis) to it that makes it feel gentle and inviting, but playful. It would work well for a family-minded audience, for example, whereas the bottom one would work well for, I guess, a bee minded audience? The bottom is being direct, using longer words, and isn’t using any language technique to add emphasis to any part of it which creates a pretty flat tone. The flat tone isn’t overly inviting, at least compared to the top sentence, but it does have its place in the world today. Technical writing, writing clear instructions for a product, doesn’t need you to feel anything towards it, it just needs to get the point across in the simplest way so that you can start using the product as soon as possible, so flat is actually preferred! I’m going to revisit that ‘feel something’ phrasing later, but hopefully this shows you the role that the most well known element of copywriting, tone, has in this whole thing.</p>

                    <div class="articlefiller"></div>

                    <p class="filmtext">But, wait. Where do writers pluck this tone from? They can’t just choose one at random until they settle on one that works after all! That would be inefficient, and efficiency is the name of the game in today’s economy. Much like an olympic athlete prepares for that gold medal attempt by training then, businesses have to take a long, hard look at their goals and target audience in order to figure out who they want to be.<br><br>How do your target audience speak? Do they use contractions? Emojis? Do they expect a more formal tone, or can you approach them more casually? What do they like about your product? Why do they use it? How do they use it? There are a million and one questions you could ask, and each one gets you a little closer to shaping the kind of voice you want your company to have.<br><br><u>Keywords</u><br><br>On top of this, copywriters -- and especially SEO minded ones -- think about keywords an awful lot. This is another topic that could be an article in itself, but, essentially, these are the words that you want to use for search engines like Google to direct to your page, as well as being the words that customers latch onto when thinking about the product. Keywords might attract your target audience, but a big part of their use is actually getting people to see what you do in the first place.<br><br>If you have a company that specialises in stuffed corgi toys, for example, the most obvious keywords here are going to be things like ‘corgi’, ‘stuffed toy, and ‘toy’ and it’ll be hard to avoid using these naturally in your copy anyway. But why not push the boat out? Why settle for the same keywords that everyone else is using, like ‘stuffed toy’, and try different keywords that will help you find a niche in the market and drive up sales? There are hundreds of tools online for analysing stuff like this, but it will also be informed by research on how your audience speaks. You might end up targeting things like ‘adorable corgi’, or ‘doggo stuffed toy’ based on that too, but this is an art form in itself.<br><br>I should note that SEO is a complicated beast, and goes far deeper than merely what is written on a website. The very code underlying that website needs to be written with it in mind, from special HTML tags to the very architecture of the site (what links to what), but this is very much a topic for another day.<br><br><u>Peacocking</u></p>

                    <div class="articlefiller"></div>
                    <img class="img-responsive articlesubimage" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6469/products/Peacock_Looking_Up_1024x1024.jpg?v=1423750411" />
                    <p class="filmtext"><i>Such beautiful feathering</i></p>
                    <div class="articlefiller"></div>

                    <p class="filmtext">Another technique that writers use to capture their audience is ‘peacocking’. In nature, peacocks divert a lot of their energy into growing big, beautiful tails that don’t benefit them in the wild at all. Sure, a skittish predator might be intimidated, but the tail uses up energy from food and makes moving around and flying far more difficult than it needs to be. The only benefit of this tail is to attract females; if a male is so good at surviving and gathering food that he has energy to spare into growing a big, clumsy, bloody beautiful tail, it must have some damn good genes.<br><br>In the advertising world generally, peacocking takes the form of making your adverts the most striking ones out there. Doing something different. Being bold. Attracting all those peahens. Maybe not that last one though… It means making what you do and how you do it different in some way to what is already out there, because people are sensitive to things that break patterns (think of Wendy’s witty tweets and the chatter around them). This is referred to in memory psychology as the isolation effect (Schmidt, 1991) and highlights that an item in a list that doesn’t fit in with the other items (e.g. “T-Rex” in a list of vegetables) is more memorable, and what do copywriters want if not to make their company memorable? This is an exciting effect too because it’s been observed on a deeper neurological level, and the neurons involved seem to respond plastically based on electrical activity in the neuron previously; as the cells that react to this interesting new stimuli are different to the ones reacting to the same-old same-old other stimuli, we get a stronger reaction which creates a larger effect and a more robust network to that neuron (makes it more memorable, essentially; Lynch, 2003).<br><br>Is… Is no one else excited about that? Okay.<br><br><u>To conclude techniques...</u><br><br>This is just a handful of ways that writers twist their words into attracting an audience, and I can guarantee that it has happened to you many times in your life. There are some brands that you prefer purely based on… Well, maybe you can’t put your finger on it. The adverts and website are memorable though, they speak to you in some way, they make you feel something towards them, and that is where I want to jump in on a psychological level. The ultimate goal of all of these writers is to make you feel, after all, and this is the very goal that makes use of a primal part of our brain to draw us in. </p>

                    <h4><b>Our primal brain</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">I mentioned earlier that good writing makes us feel something, and this feeling - or more specifically empathy in this case - is a key part of who and what we are; we are emotional animals, and our capacity for empathy is both immense and a core part of our evolutionary history. While we see empathy in a similar sense in other species, be it the long term pair-bonding of animals to help raise young or the social group behaviour of apes or wolves, it is humans that took the idea and ran with it. As Dunbar highlights in his quite famous book Human Evolution, it is likely to have been our increasing reliance on being able to communicate effectively with each other that actually led to the rapid increase in our brain volume and, eventually, resulted in some scrawny upright apes becoming a worldwide dominant species.<br><br>In the context of copywriting and UX writing, I want to talk about the neural simulation element of empathy specifically. In essence, when we see someone else doing something, our brains act as if it were us doing it in order to figure out how to react to it. This was first observed with physical actions, discovered in monkeys through simple hand gestures (Rizzolatti, et al. 1996) and later in humans with mouth actions like talking or eating (Ferrari, et al. 2003; Google ‘mirror neurons’ to learn more about the field). You can see where I’m going with this though: The brain simulates emotional states pretty darn effectively (in healthy cases) too, be it disgust (Wicker, et al. 2003), fear and anger (Goldman, & Sripada, 2005), pain (Singer, et al. 2004; Jackson, et al. 2005), happiness (Morelli, et al. 2014) and so many more. Impairments in people with brain damage to these observed mirroring areas of the brain also serves to further enforce the finding (Calder, et al. 2000; Adolphs, et al. 2003), so it seems like a nicely robust theory. <br><br>You may have heard about all of this before from a study that a lot of news outlets picked up a few years ago about botox users struggling to read the emotions of others. The essential idea here being that the chemical limits muscle movement in the face which, in turn, stops you physically mirroring someone else’s emotional states, negative or positive. The emotional mirroring in the brain likely still happens, but without the physical element you get half of the picture and the other half is surprisingly difficult to decipher (Neal. & Chartrand, 2011). This separation between the physical micro-mimicry of emotional action and the emotional, internal mimicry of mental states is key in the context of this article though, purely because the vast majority of brand imagery and voice that we consume does not elicit a physical mimicry response in us, but it does get at our internal empathy circuits. We don’t need the other half of the picture in this case, we’re not trying to communicate or relate to the other party in this exchange, we are just interpreting and internalising an emotion or idea that is being shown to us.<br><br>Adverts that appeal to our senses broadly, like visual designs or the smell of fresh bread as you walk through a supermarket, are considered ‘sensory marketing’ in the literature (Krishna, 2011; Krishna, & Schwarz, 2013). There isn’t much research directly on written sensory marketing sadly, but that doesn’t mean that we haven’t looked into it tangentially: we have known and explored the fact that we can empathise with characters in books or plays for years, after all (Hammond, & Kim, 2014; Beirl, et al. 2015), so there is a lot of power in written language. <br><br>We have established then that interpreting the emotional substance of other people or things is something that we are pretty darn good at, and, in order to do it, we play out the same emotion inside our heads. To jump back up to the copywriting techniques above, we start to get a picture of why exactly they are so effective: when a piece of text speaks with a tone of voice that you are familiar with, when it speaks in a way that you see and enjoy all the time, when it catches your eye with words or bold attitudes, you genuinely feel something, whether you’re aware of it or not. It is no secret in psychology that we love things similar to ourselves (less chance of being betrayed compared to unknown quantities; Greenberg, 2010; Curry, & Dunbar, 2013) so when an entire company is speaking to us in a familiar and entertaining voice, we can’t help but be drawn in.<br><br><u>Wrapping it up</u><br><br>There is a lot that I love about copywriting and UX writing, but I think it’s the interaction with our psychology that excites me the most. Language is powerful, it gave us these (relatively) big brains, and there is clearly a huge place for it even in today’s visuals-centric world.</p>
