                <p class="filmtext">
                    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">DmC: Devil May Cry does many things incredibly well, but it was met with a lot (and I mean a lot) of criticism when it was first announced by die hard fans of the series. Dante, the white-haired glam star of the show had been changed to a younger, grittier version of himself, apparently on merit of rebranding the franchise into something more accessible to a broader and more ‘modern’ Western audience. By definition of that, long-time fans felt like their Dante was being taken away from them, and even the director of the first game, Hideki Kamiya, was disappointed with the design. He wasn’t the only one either, with critics and gamers casting wary looks at Dante’s dark hair and scowl and metaphorically crossing the street to avoid eye contact. You know what, though? Hideki Kamiya, despite his wariness, latter defended the game: he urged people to play it and praised Ninja Theory, the developers, as talented people who were treating the series with respect.<br><br>In the face of all of this backlash, it takes an awful lot of mettle for a studio to not cave in to pressure and still power ahead with their own design. Capcom were behind them, but the people were skeptical, and the developers definitely knew that. Speaking with VG 24/7, Alex Jones, the producer of DmC, stated:
</p><br>
                
                <blockquote><i>“Being angry about it – yeah I get that – but we always said, ‘when you see the game and you play it, trust me, you’re going to understand that we were doing the right thing”</i>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p class="filmtext">Guess what? That’s exactly what happened. It didn’t help with sales, and they were still far below what Capcom was hoping for (attributed to a miscommunication between marketing and development teams), but DmC is still a genuinely incredibly good, well put together game. The design is consistent, the humor is still there in force, the boss design is fantastic, stage design is even better… I could sing its praises all day, but you know what praises I haven’t heard people sing about explicitly yet? The user experience that the game cultivates. You can tell that it was built from the ground up with an empathy and understanding of its users in mind, and it damn well shows. So, let me list the ways that this unfortunately titled star shines…
