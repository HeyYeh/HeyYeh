                <p class="filmtext">
                    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">Games these days are obsessed with giving their players unique experiences, ‘water cooler moments’ that they can tell their friends about, and where they can listen eagerly to other people’s approaches to the same problem. There’s something very cathartic, and very human, in hearing how one person took the straightforward sword-swinging route, while another snuck around and avoided confrontation all together, while another still stood out of reach on a cliff and fired arrows for 30 minutes until the giant slumped into a heap of toes and gold… Sorry, Skyrim flashbacks. Speaking of Skyrim though, VR is another route into giving players this unique experience; after all, you’re looking around with your own muscles, interacting with things creatively and in ways that don’t feel planned.  It isn’t unique to you really, it’s still programmed and structured, but it certainly feels that way, and it’s this little chunk of the ‘immersive experience’ that I want to talk about today.<br><br>Psychologists have many tools in their arsenal for investigating individual differences in people, after all, and some of them have been used for many, many years. The personality test is a keen example, and some games have already used these to guide the player into gameplay styles or routes that aim to enhance their personal experience. How effective are they though, and do they have a secure place in the world of game development today? I want to offer a broad perspective on this, so I am going to give a little history lesson on personality tests in general to give some context (feel free to skip this though), explore how games have already used these tests to see how effective they are and how they may be incorporated, and offer some psychological mechanisms behind why these might help improve the gameplay experience in general. Let’s get stuck in!</p>
                
                <h4><b>A brief history of ‘how do you feel about <i>X</i>?’</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">Back in the 19th century, something called ‘The Lexical Hypothesis’ was picking up steam thanks to some theory crafting by a sir Francis Galton. Galton was a bit of a big deal (and continues to be long after his death) for many reasons, and across many different fields; he coined the term ‘nature vs nurture’, developed a way of classifying fingerprints for forensic science, developed the statistical concept of the correlation, and was a cousin of Charles Darwin whose evolution work got him obsessed with heredity, to name just a few. His insights on the lexical hypothesis as a tool to observe personality is what matters to us today though, thanks to his love of measuring things (he was also a pioneer in the use of questionnaires as a way of measuring people in general because of course he was.).<br><br>The lexical hypothesis has two main ideas behind it: the personality traits that matter most to people and that are most relevant to them will find their way into the language more easily than less relevant traits, and that the traits that are most prevalent will be represented by more single words than less prevalent traits. Representing the world by how people talk about it could be thought of as support for ‘naïve realism’, a term in psychology used to describe a human tendency to believe that we see and talk about the world objectively and that anyone who doesn’t is misinformed, biased, or just plain wrong. This could be a whole other topic, but is relevant here because it is also the basis of a lot of cognitive biases, which we will talk about later.<br><br>The lexical hypothesis makes sense though; we talk about what we experience, think, and feel, and we are always happy to accept other people or cultures doing the same. We are happy to say ‘yup, makes sense’ if we’re told that Eskimos have around 50 words for snow’, or that Hawaiians have 102 words for ‘sweet potato’ (a beloved native food), so why wouldn’t we have many words for the personality traits that we see most? Support was found for this too, with Allport and Odbert (1936) analysing the two main English dictionaries of the time and factor analysing down to 17,953 words that reference personality, and from that they found about 4,504 single adjectives for different personality traits (along with three other categories less relevant to this article). Thanks to the new field of computing in 1946, Raymond Cattell further analysed that big word list and distilled it into 16 ‘factors’ (categories) that were the basis of the 16PF questionnaire, which is still in use today (though has some methodological criticisms).<br><br>A long story short, after many many re-tests, further factor analyses (Norman, 1963), and the work of Air Force researchers (Tupes and Christal, 1961), that huge list of words was boiled down to just five categories that seemed to represent a huge swathe of personalities. These categories are Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness (the <abbr title="Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness - Personality Index (The name put in place before Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were added)">NEO-PI</abbr>; Costa, & McCrae, 1985). You can rate high in a category, or low in a category, and you can find out where you stand with just a questionnaire. This became more commonly known as the Big 5, and was the basis for a huge amount of modern personality testing. The Myer-Briggs Type Indicator test is one such example, and you may have seen the four letter results from it (INTJ, ENFP, etc.) in dating apps, and twitter profiles aplenty – I won’t go into detail on this because it is a pretty terrible test from a methodology (and kinda theory) standpoint, but that’s a whole other story.<br><br>These Big 5 based tests tend to take measurements based on a 5 point Likert scale, which is just a scale of 1 to 5, with ‘agree strongly’ on one end, and ‘disagree strongly’ on the other. You can try taking a version of a Big 5 test <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/tests/personality/big-five-personality-test">here</a>, or a Myer-Briggs test <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">here</a> to see what I mean. Equally, personality tests can have simple ‘true/false’ answers too, much like the very first personality test made by a man named Robert Woodsworth after World War 1 (1919), and was actually used to test potential soldiers before full conscription (they learned a lot about shell shock in the war and wanted to avoid taking on people who were prone to it). You can have a go at that test <a href="http://personality-testing.info/tests/WPI.php">here</a>. Videogames tend to lean towards the Big 5 style of testing (except when they don’t, but we’ll get there). They do tend to give you options instead of a 1-5 scale, but these options correspond to one outcome and the more points you get in that outcome the more likely you are to get that result, as you can expect. When I say ‘personality test’ in reference to games though, it’s important to note that this really means an assessment of what the player will enjoy, rather than who the player is as a person.<br><br>Personality testing, as you can see, has a long history and an awful lot of variability, and we’re going to be seeing more of that in the sections to come. Today, there are companies who specialise in personality testing to determine how well you will perform in a job (bit of an iffy usage, but hey) and it has become an industry worth billions in itself. Is it time that we started flooding our games with them too? Is this a quick route to giving players unique feeling experiences? And what psychological mechanisms underlie these choices that we can learn from and expand?</p>

                <h4><b>Fallout 3, and the thrilling Fallout: New Vegas</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">I wanted to start with a couple of bad examples of personality testing, but wonderful examples of game design, and Fallout is a great example of this. You see, Fallout 3 opens with two personality tests in a row: the G.O.A.T. to determine which job you’ll have in the vault (*cough* and your best starting skills *cough*), and the more subtle one of a morality test right before it. Outside of the testing room, the Tunnel Snakes (rule) are bullying your friend Amata and you can either help her, leave her, or join in, starting you on a moral path before you’ve even left the vault. Morality is a key factor in Fallout 3, but it is also a dichotomy: you are either good or bad and not both, but the world of personality testing is a little more complex than that. If you want to read/hear more about morality though, <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2017/07/podcast-29-morality-and-moral-choices-in-video-games/">this</a> podcast is pretty fantastic for it.<br><br>The G.O.A.T. have 10 questions (but only 9 ones that we care about, one is a filler question), and they are all scenarios in which you are given four potential answers. Each answer corresponds to a skill, and you are recommended a profession and set of tag skills based on which ones have more points. This use of a personality test is designed to guide you into a certain play style that may suit your interests or sensibilities, and it fits beautifully into the lore of the world rather than sticking out as some examples later on seem to. This one is very interesting, however, because the game goes pretty far out of its way to let you avoid this test all together. You can skip the test and choose your skills straight away, tell the npc running the test to do it for you based on a general direction from you, or say that you didn’t like the results of the test and just choose your skills after anyway. In fact, in my many playthroughs of that game, I don’t think I ever just accepted what the test gave me…<br><br>In this case, the test here seems to be guidance for the player as a secondary objective. The primary goal of this test is immersion, and world building. You go through the motions of an actual test, not just picking options from a pop-up; you know the in-game consequences of the test, and every teenager has to take it; and you even get some lore friendly flavour text based on the job that you’re assigned (though some are a little odd: a preference for energy weapons means you’re given a podiatrist job (foot lasers?) and an interest in medicine gets you assigned as a clinical test subject, not the doctor; aspiration). Fallout 3 is a game of freedom and choice in general, and the ability to completely forego even taking the test is a symbolic one. This is the developers saying <i>“that’s right, do whatever you want in this world we have given you”</i> and that mood manipulation in players itself is a very clever use of a personality test in a videogame.<br><br>Now Fallout: New Vegas is similar, but this one genuinely excites me from a lore perspective. Why? Because it also appeals to the psychology nerd in me too! This game opens with you getting shot in the head, naturally, and you wake up with no memory. A local doctor gives you a few tests to determine your tag skills- er, personality just like in 3, but the nature of these tests is very different. In order, you do a free association task (give the first word that pops into your head from this prompt), a personality profile test (a 5 point Likert scale for strongly agree-strongly disagree), and a Rorschach test (ink blots where you say what they show). The Fallout universe, if you didn’t know, splits from our timeline around the 50s and, in their timeline, culture doesn’t really advance beyond that (thus all of the old music on the radio), and, you guessed it, all of these tests were at a height of popularity around that time! This is thanks to Freud, who pushed his psychodynamic approach at the time. This was focused on subconscious thought and repressed urges, and he suggested that the only way to explore these is by discovering them through free association (the first test), or free interpretation (the Rorschach test, but this test was actually first made in the 20s). Therefore, these tests would be the ones most likely to remain through the apocalypse and be shown in the 50s style Fallout world; isn’t that amazing writing?! Just me… Okay…<br><br>Anyway, there’s a little less emphasis than 3 on being able to skip these tests, but the mere fact that you can reinforces that freedom element. There is some irony in the fact that merely giving suggested answers for the association tests ruins their real-world validity, but this is, after all, a videogame and not a reflection on your deep dark past. This use of personality testing reinforces the lore, player choice, and, naturally, immersion.</p>
                
                <h4><b>Immersion; no answer is still an answer for a rogue</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">You often see these personality tests in role playing games, and this comes down to both a format thing and a conceptual thing. In format, role playing games simply tend to have more text, and you can expect the players to read or make a longer series of answers and choices because that is the standard format (and player) of an RPG. Fallout is an odd RPG, so they are presented in odd ways, but they are still text focused when all is said and done. You do get cases like Kingdom Hearts, an action focused RPG with some personality test elements, but these are presented fairly uniquely, and not many choices are actually made.<br><br>In concept, RPGs want you to play a character and they are invested in making you feel like that character. How best to reflect you than by getting insight into who you are, how you play? Fallout 4 met a lot of criticism for losing many (many) of the RPG elements of the two previous games in the series, becoming more of a shooter with RPG elements that what the series was known for, and one of these things it stripped away was a personality test. Of course this is nowhere near the straw that broke the camel’s back, but it is indicative of the creative direction they went in this time. The freedom that we discussed in the previous section, that freedom to answer how you want or not even answer at all, immediately makes you connect with your character in a unique way, because <i>you</i> are your character. You made the choice to make no choices, so your avatar reflects you and you become immersed within that first half hour.<br><br><a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2013/11/the-psychology-of-video-game-avatars/">The Psychology of Videogames</a> blog has written a much more comprehensive post about how we identify with our on-screen avatars, highlighting early on how we seem to create idealised versions of ourselves and we often feel more satisfied with the game when we feel our avatar reflects us and our choices. A personality test may be a great way of giving players that shared identity, making them satisfied, by making their avatar as close to them as possible from a behavioural standpoint. This even seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy: we seem to behave as we would expect our avatar to, be they a hero or villain, and we feel more satisfied when we do. Following from before, if we’re playing a version of ourselves, and we’re making choices that our avatar self would make, there’s reason to believe this would only increase the game’s satisfaction dramatically.</p>

                 <h4><b>Ultima IV – The trend setter</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">I want to move on to the more traditional format of these player tests in videogames now, so I will talk about a few similar games in much less detail, starting with what seems to be the grand daddy of this feature… Ultima IV!<br><br>This game released in 1985 on the Apple II, so when I say that it is a trend setter in this case, I really mean that it’s a trend setter. Unlike the previous three games in the series, this one has you figure out your stats, class, and starting location by having a gypsy ask you 28 questions in a row, each with two answers. These answers correlate to one of the 8 virtues of the Avatar each (thinks like honesty (you become a mage), honour (you become a paladin), or humility (you become a shepherd). The game tasks you with becoming the avatar by mastering all 8 of these virtues, but it starts off small. Each question the gypsy asks is some kind of ethical dilemma and you answer via tarot cards, like how you would react to a bully pushing for a fight, or whether you give your money away or pass it to your family when you die a wealthy old person. You can actually take this quiz in full at <a href="http://www.tk421.net/ultima/">this link!</a><br><br>Without going too in depth, this example is pretty close to what we might traditionally think of as a personality test, in theming if nothing else. The questions have no right answers and really do highlight individual differences, and they also tie into an inherent morality that further offers to reflect your character as an extension of you. It is lore friendly, presented within the context of the game and the game’s world, and even offers nice visual cues in the cards themselves. It is a little long, but, regardless, there seems to be a lot of nostalgia around this test floating around the internet. As the first example of this, a lot of games did emulate this format and style to a large degree, such as Ragnarok online or Final Fantasy Tactics A2 (a favourite of mine). I’ll talk about the psychology here a little more in a moment, but first, a similar but slightly different example.</p>
                
                <h4><b>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon – Explorers of sky (and you)</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">At the start of many of the Pokemon mystery dungeon games, you are given a personality test to determine who your starting Pokemon is and, therefore, who you will be playing as. Often, you are a human transformed into a Pokemon, so it makes sense to try and line up your personality to your result (those poor Bulbasaur people…). The games after Explorers of Sky made this redundant by letting you choose after the quiz anyway (a point that will be raised again later), and I have chosen Sky because it is an interesting format for one of these quizzes.<br><br>As I said at the start of this, games want to give you what feels like a personal, original experience, and, in this case, even the questions asked are likely to feel unique to you (at least if you talk about it with your friends). You are asked just 8 questions (keeping potential boredom down in their target audience), out of a pool of a remarkable 64 questions. These questions are randomly selected, but there will always be the same question to start it, and the same one to end it. At the start, you are asked if you played the last Mystery Dungeon game, and if you say yes to this, it biases the questions you are given towards helping you choose one of the new Pokemon. After you answer these, you are always asked which gender you are, and this is the final deciding factor for your starter. There are 20 potential outcomes based on your answers; each of the 16 Pokemon natures (personality; bold, lonely, relaxed) have two based on male or female, and some choices are male or female exclusive. You can view all of these questions <a href="https://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/955859-pokemon-mystery-dungeon-explorers-of-sky/faqs/58014">here</a>, but, they are in the standard question and potential answers format that we have already seen.<br><br>I find this one interesting because it is an extreme case of another nice benefit that these quizzes have; helping you make a choice.</p>
                
                <h4><b>Helping you make a choice then feel good about it; cognitive load, and an ass</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">I have spoken about cognitive load previously (the mortal enemy of smooth design), but I endeavour to approach it in different terms each time. Today, I want to talk about Buridan’s Ass – Buridan, I should add, was a 14th century French philosopher who made this thought experiment famous by applying it to a donkey. The whole thing is that a donkey who is equally hungry and equally thirsty, when placed an equal distance between a bundle of hay and a bale of water, will be unable to choose one or the other, so will stay still until it dies. A morbid, extreme example of choice paralysis, but it’s effective; when presented with many choices, or choices between things that are indiscernibly different in quality (like all options to someone naïve of the game), people just don’t want to make the choices. It puts cognitive load on them, and this can be pretty big when comparing the 20 different options of starter Pokemon (I remember struggling with three in the main games), or the 8 classes in Ultima, or the 13 skills in Fallout: New Vegas.<br><br>A personality test, or ‘player test’ might be more accurate, makes that choice for the player while reinforcing avatar empathy as mentioned before, and guiding them into playstyles that they will like. They can serve to take the pain of choosing player builds or classes away, and create a more streamlined, enjoyable experience. But that’s not all! Having the option to ignore the results of the test, or more significantly the test altogether, is also a good feature to include in some ways. Chernev (2003) displayed that individuals with experience in a field actually prefer larger sets of options; if we have veteran RPG players starting a new game, they will already know that they have a preference for rogues, for example. A veteran Pokemon player will know that they like Riolu, or Eevee.  Ultima IV didn’t have this luxury to quite the same degree; videogames were a young creation in many ways still, and the industry was still recoiling from the market crash in 1983 (a drop in revenue by 97%), so it was less reasonable to expect your players to even know how a bard played, let alone that they would suit its playstyle. It might feel like a cop-out to some, but it’s pretty important for appealing to all players.<br><br>But… Is there not a better way to do this? Personally, I am actually a big fan of doing these personality quizzes in games, but I acknowledge that my interest in methodology makes me an unusual case. You could even argue that most rpg players are open to these quizzes, given the genre that you tend to find them in, but if these quizzes or player evaluations have such useful benefits, why should we be satisfied with not using them in as many other genres as possible too?</p>

                <h4><b>The future of the player test/branching into other genres – ft. Special Guest: Oblivion</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">People who like twitch shooters, you could reasonably guess (but I would love to see data too), don’t want to spend 15 minutes answering a series of questions when they start a game. Let’s imagine a game that is a single player, fast paced shooter, but it has a few rpg elements, and it even has a fair few starting ‘classes’ which offer different weapons and playstyles depending on what you enjoy. You can’t expect players to know how all of these classes feel to play, so you want to give them a slight guiding hand, and how might you do this?<br><br>The easiest, least creative solution is pure tutorialisation. You let the player actually try out all of these playstyles throughout the tutorial, and then let them commit later on when they’re a little more informed. This is the approach that Skyrim takes, urging you to try out the bow and arrow, try out the axe, and try out spurts of flames to see what clicks. There is nothing wrong with this approach at all, and actually gives developers a chance to show off the variety of approaches that they have made, but it doesn’t suit every example. If your game has many, many options, or the differences between styles or approaches would be too jarring to play in sequence without some interim.<br><br>Oblivion approaches this in an intriguing way, but also an imperfect one – I know I have spoken about Bethesda games a lot here, but it’s not my fault that they like to experiment with features! – In Oblivion’s tutorial section, in which you get freed from jail on the caveat that you have to punch rats for a while, you eventually reach a point where an npc recommends a character class to you based on the actual actions that you used most in that tutorial. If you snuck around a lot, they will suggest sneaky builds, if you took great pleasure in slapping rats, they will recommend melee builds. The issue is that there just isn’t the opportunity to use all of the potential skills in the game in that period, so you will never be suggested many of these potential classes. Okay, the execution was a little shaky, but this idea of a game reacting and guiding the player based on their actions, rather than their self-report answers to questions is an exciting one though.<br><br>Left 4 Dead 1 and 2, as a parallel display of this, feature inherent dynamic systems that react to the player’s actions. There is an ‘AI Director’ (so called because the L4D campaigns are made to feel like films) who dynamically changes a fair few interesting things in these campaigns: it influences the structure of the map (traps, routes, weapons) based on how well players are doing and if they need more challenge;  it will spawn mobs of enemies to urge players not to stay in one place for too long to encourage pacing and excitement; it spawns special enemies in dynamically determined locations to encourage exciting gameplay; and many more! I would love to a good write-up on AI in games like this, but, if you’re curious for now, definitely read <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2009/ai_systems_of_l4d_mike_booth.pdf">this</a> overview created by Valve themselves of AI in the original L4D.</p>
                
                 <h4><b>Where does all of this leave us exactly?</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">I want to start out this conclusion by establishing that there is a place for traditional questionnaire style personality tests in games today. There are players that enjoy it, it benefits both new and veteran players, it can both support and enhance lore, and it has benefits beyond these as I have discussed. Reactive games, however, are a very exciting concept that may provide the same benefits as that questionnaire design, except with even further reduced cognitive load; no longer are you guiding the player based on what they think, but on how they actually behave, and the two are quite separate entities in humans in general. This does depend on the game’s format, and it does require more work than you might like, but it would be incredible to see more games follow in the footsteps of Oblivion’s experiment and Left 4 Dead’s dynamic replayability as a route to making unique, memorable experiences. Don’t get rid of personality tests, but don’t feel limited by them either.</p>
