                        <li>Yes, by definitions in the literature, but the actual users are split.</li><br>

                    <br>
                    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">Picture the scene: creatures a couple of steps back in the evolution of human beings sitting in their camp. They look similar to us but just a little more primal, a little closer to nature than we are now. They’re dirtier, their proportions are just a little different, and they have significantly fewer gadgets hanging off of their bodies. One of them stands to move to their bedding and trips, falling face first into the dust and causing ripples of loud, deep, punctuated noises from the rest of the group. Happy, simple noises as they exhale: early laughter, stumbled into evolutionarily thanks to the structure of our diaphragms, but a fantastic tool for helping a social group form. All social animals need to groom, need to interact with the group to keep the group together, and if you stick to physical grooming alone you’re going to be spending most of your time going between each member of the group. As human’s social groups increased, we needed a more time efficient way of doing that and laughter was a great start, followed by early language to coordinate and interact, which then refined (slowly) into what we have today. The most convincing reason for it, and there are many theories, is gossip. If you’re talking about other people, you’re forming and defining the barriers of a group by positive or negative reinforcement. Today, our language abilities have allowed us to shoot up from the small bands of people in our biological history, to a rough limit of around 150 now (known as ‘Dunbar’s number’).<br><br>Dunbar’s number has been shown to correlate to Facebook too, with the average number of at least semi-regular contacts that a user has being around 150 (Dunbar, 2011). Discussing this would be a whole other article, but it does show that the digital world of social media reflects, to some degree, the physical world where we all actually interact. The thing is though, Facebook is very explicitly a social network – so much so that a film about it was called ‘The Social Network’ – but Steam isn’t, and a film about Steam is more likely to be called “Gabe’s Big Day Out’ than anything related to socialising, but that doesn’t mean that Steam isn’t social.<br><br>There are a few different types of general social network, but, for our purposes, Steam would likely fall into the category of a ‘Community of Interest’. As you can guess, this is simply a gathering of people united by a common interest rather than the traditional social bonds. They display the usual four aspects of a psychological sense of community (belonging, fulfilment of needs, influence, and shared connections; McMillan, and Chavis, 1986), and often the more recently-ish added fifth aspect of conscious identification (Obst, Zinkiewicz, and Smith, 2001; 2002). I’ll talk a little about the definitions of a social network later, but that conscious identification bit is intriguing. Steam is certainly a place where people of a common interest in videogames go, but it’s not just a place for sharing that interest; a pretty huge part of it is the store, so does the mere presence of the store make people identify with the community aspect less? Do most people identify with it at all? Are the store and the community features functionally two different psychological organisms?<br><br>I decided to try and look into these, so I will do a few things here: report the results of a questionnaire I sent out about this, put Steam under the test of other social network definitions, and compare a few design elements of these other websites to Steam to see if it measures up practically if nothing else. Let’s find some answers!</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive articlesubimage" src="http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/dreamhack-night-shot.jpg" />
                <p class="filmtext"><i>Dreamhack's 12,000 person LAN party - there's no doubt that gaming can be social in general.</i></p>
                <h4><b>Socially conscious, and consciously social – Results!</b></h4>
                    <p class="filmtext"><i>As a heads up, this is the stats section and gets a bit dense near the bottom. I have tried to make it a little nicer, but feel free to jump to the next section for a summary if this bit bores the pants off of you.</i><br><br>First of all let’s talk about my sample by starting with a tip for researchers out there: try to avoid giving ‘other’ as an option under gender or a surprising amount of people will say that they are some kind of helicopter or gun… The data from these, and a few other cases, were naturally removed from the final pool! Anyway, I recruited my participants from /r/Steam on Reddit: while this is a relatively limited source, it does guarantee that I am quizzing Steam users, and it suggests that they are all very into videogames (91.4% said that they play for more than 5 hours a week). Reddit is itself a community of interest, so, while it does skew data a little, we are still looking at a population who may not consciously view reddit as a social media platform either. We’ll talk about that in just a moment. After removing the rough entries from above, we were left with a sample of 635… 635! That’s a pretty damn good turn-out and, if you do the math, should provide a decently representative sample of Steam’s 125million users, and gives us a margin of error of only 3.89%, which is also quite nice. <br><br>As for what I actually asked participants: first of all, the big question of ‘Do you think Steam is a social network?’ We want to find out if this is a conscious thing, after all. I also asked about how often they look at the Steam store, the community pages, and whether they look at the store or community more than the other to see if there is a relationship between the use of various Steam features and social network participation. I then asked how many items of a list of a community features that they had browsed recently: the maximum score was 9 and the average was 4.03. That average isn’t an indication of the degree to which they browse, but this average ‘browsiness’ level shows how broadly interested they are in community features. I also asked the same about how much they contributed to various features, with the maximum being 9 and an average ‘shariness’ score here of 1.77 – people browse much more than they contribute, unsurprisingly! Finally, I asked if people actually trust Steam with their information just to see if trust has any impact on perception of a social media.<br><br>Surprisingly, whether Steam was a social network or not was quite split! 55.2% thought that it was, and 44.8% thought that it wasn’t. More people primarily browsed the steam store over the community features too, 373 to 262 respectively, but this choice didn’t really help whether they thought that Steam was a social network: only 32.87% of the people that said Steam was NOT a social network regularly browsed the community features, but those that said that it WAS a social network don’t have much difference. 51.86% go on the store more, and 48.14% go on the community features more.<br><br>We do still have some deeper analysis that might help us delineate the two. For example, people who rate highly in browsiness and shariness do positively correlate significantly with those that say that it is a social network (correlation co-efficients of 0.22, and 0.23 respectively with a score of 1 meaning suspiciously perfect correlation). Further still, every category of contributing to the Steam community was also significantly positively correlated with considering it a social network except for contributing videos and broadcasts, likely because there were far fewer of them. The biggest correlation for browsers and contributors were friends profiles (0.25 and 0.18 respectively) and screenshots (0.18 and 0.16 respectively), all of which were statistically, happily, significant findings (p=&lt;0.05).<br><br>Finally, because we all love stats, a one way ANOVA also showed that those that regularly browse the steam store and those that consider Steam a social network are not statistically similar groups (they don’t have similar means; p = 0.00), while those that regularly browse the community pages and those that say Steam is a social network are statistically similar groups (similar means; p = 0.201).</p>
                    <h4><b>In ENGLISH dammit!</b></h4>
                    <p class="filmtext">Okay, okay, not everyone likes stats. The take home messages are below:</p>
                    <div class="articlefiller"></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Pretty much half of the people thought that Steam was a social network.</i></li><br>
                        <li><i>The people that said that it wasn’t a social network used the community features much less than the people that said that it was, but the people that said that it was use the steam store and the community fairly equally.</i></li><br>
                        <li><i>Of the people that say Steam is a social network, interacting with friends and looking at or sharing screenshots were the biggest predictors of thinking this.</i></li><br>
                        <li><i>The stats show that the people who actually use the community features seem to be the same people that are saying it IS a social network. </i></li><br>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><b>What makes a social network?</b></h4>
                    <p class="filmtext">So we are in bit of an odd place after that: see, the people that use the community features more self-identify as being part of the Steam social network more than people that don’t, but the people that don’t still use the store, and using the community features doesn’t guarantee seeing Steam as a social network either. Maybe the individuals that don’t still perceive themselves as part of the much broader ‘Gamer’ social category, but that doesn’t help us answer our question about Steam being definitively a social network or not. If one definition fails us then, let’s see how well other ones fit! For example, the most basic definition of a social network you’ll see (and this isn’t about websites), is that they display ‘non-trivial clustering’ (fancy words for ‘friends add each other instead of adding random people’), and ‘homophily’ (‘a fancy word for sharing characteristics between one another) (Newman, and Park, 2003; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook, 2001). Steam fits these, but it would do so just as well as a pure store as it would a networking site; gamers who lover certain genres crowd to and review those genres, and the entire population share the characteristic of liking both games, and that genre.<br><br>Mislove, et al. (2007; outdated for the tech world, but we’re looking at principles) studied a few big names in the online social network world and they proposed a nodal network – people (nodes) who have more friends and links in the network are seen as more trustworthy and more representative of the social group. Steam has this with the curators, but again, in an online store these could just be star reviewers. They did highlight a few characteristics to define a network too: user based, interactive, community-driven, relationship formation, and emotion over content. Ooh, now we’re getting somewhere! These features all focus on the people that make up the group, and a store alone can’t explain them: sure, a store is interactive and user based or it’s not a good store, but the steam groups are community driven, as is the workshop, and most other community features; the groups promote building relationships with other members, they provide pretty much all of the content for the community, and even in our little questionnaire people who interacted with friends more felt that Steam was a social network. Better still, a more recent paper supports these characteristics nicely for online social network sites (Obar, Jonathan, Wildman, Steve, 2015)! But… what about emotion over content?</p>
                <div class="articlefiller"></div>
                    <img class="img-responsive articlesubimage" src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/YO2jGz3.jpg" />
                <p class="filmtext"><i>Nothing is true, everything is permitted - as good a definition of post-truth as you could ask for!</i></p>
                <div class="articlefiller"></div>
                <h4><b>Emotion over content; Fake News</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">In 2016, the Oxford University Press’ word of the year was ‘post-truth’, which refers to a period of time where emotion and personal belief is more influential than fact in shaping public belief. Doubtlessly, we are in a post-truth age and this reflects in our social media sites more strongly than almost anywhere else. Twitter, a place where people post pictures of cats and Game of Thrones spoilers, seems to be strongly used as a primary source of news (Kwak, Lee, Park, and Moon, 2010). Trending topics are, 85% of the time, about recent news condensed into no more than a sentence, then tweeted about thousands of times in no more than 140 character chunks by people who react to the story, but don’t necessarily commit to the facts of the story. McClain (2017) does propose that Facebook may be a great way for scientists to act as ‘nerds of trust’ and fight against the dissemination of ‘alternative facts’, but that doesn’t change the fact that it is still very much in place.<br><br>You could certainly argue that the Steam community is not victim to ‘fake news’ in the same way that a normal social media network might be, and I would definitely agree. Beyond memes and satirical games, politics get relatively less attention, but that doesn’t mean that Steam isn’t emotionally driven, or that news about features in unreleased games aren’t misinterpreted or over-hyped. Further, angry or passionate reviews, frustrated forum posts, lewd mods and pictures: it makes sense that any internet forum would be emotionally driven to some extent, and, Steam’s position as a store and social network means that emotion gets results. Sometimes great results, as was the case with Bethesda’s first introduction of paid mods and the subsequent repeal of it after public outcry (don’t talk to me about E3 2017), or GTAV dipping into mostly negative reviews after their parent company decided to ban mods. At times the emotional feedback makes you a little sad too, as in the case with the Bear Simulator developer becoming so depressed they gave up development after some backlash in reviews. Equally, Steam can act as an emotional safety net for users, offering an environment where, with Steam groups, forums, or even just online games, you are always in close proximity to people who may make you feel better (or passive aggressively spam ‘Nice Shot’ after a close miss in Rocket League).<br><br>Have we done it then? Have we confirmed that Steam is a social network? Well… Not quite. While the Steam community is very much a social network with its user driven approach, we still have the store to contend with and, given our questionnaire earlier, the store is in more frequent use than the community. There wasn’t a clean split in use, but, if we can separate the two in another way, maybe we can isolate the Steam Community site as a social network site, while the store is simple a marketplace?</p>
                <h4><b>Steam in design; Why you can’t separate the store and community</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">Design is one way to disconnect two different services (in theory) because good user design is tailored for the user base. People who go to Amazon have different needs than those who go to Facebook, and it would be an easier world if this were true of the Steam community and the Steam store too. Let’s have a look at just a few design features, just to see if we’re wrong and there really is a clean line between the two (also because UX is fun).<br><br>Steam’s design is well suited to its user base for a number of reasons, and it shares some of these with other social media platforms. Colour is a pretty big thing in getting the right feel for your website, for example; social media platforms that urge action, pushing you to browse and watch and click, use reds (Pinterest, Youtube, SoundCloud). Websites where trust and relaxation are the focus, use blues (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr). Steam sports a nice dark blue (and has earned a 76% trust rating in our questionnaire) paired with black, the most eye catching colour that suggests luxury, to ease the user to focus on the store or community pages, and ease them into casual browsing where they might find new games, or vote on images, or download mods that they wouldn’t have found otherwise. It promotes a happy, window-shopping experience that brings users back again and again. The way they browse does the same thing:  Steam is known as a discovery interface, where constantly finding new things to buy or look at is the intention, and they use infinitely scrolling pages to achieve this effect. Facebook does the same thing; scrolling is an easier action than clicking, and helps you wade through the ocean of games and content on Steam to find hidden gems, and to spend money you wouldn’t have otherwise. Better still, Steam’s infinite scrolling constantly tries to tailor itself to your interest, showing games similar to others that you’ve brought, images relevant to you, recommendations from curators you like. Again, other social media does the exact same thing with great results, such as Facebook’s EdgeRank technology.<br><br>In short, Steam maintains consistent design choices across their platforms for two major reasons: a consistent image and style is always nice for branding and to give users a consistent, comfortable experience, and 2) because the user base is so similar (as our questionnaire showed) the needs of them are similar too.</p>
                <h4><b>Bringing it together</b></h4>
                <p class="filmtext">This is what it all comes down to: the needs of the user. Steam started in 2002 as a way of supporting their own games with updates and protection, then branched out to selling other publisher’s titles in 2005. The Steam Community entered the fray in 2007, and you could certainly argue that the store comes first and community features come second in their business model. Our data support this, after all, showing that the store gets more use and those that use the store more are less likely to consider Steam as a social network. Even with this, most users do use both services, so the public perception of Steam as a social network can’t be reduced to such a simple conclusion. The people that use the community features are more likely to consider it a social network, suggesting that Steam is kind of as social as you make it. If you engage with the community features, you become more conscious that it is a community. If you just shop and play games, you don’t need to consider social features so why think of it the same way you would Facebook? Public perception be damned though, Steam does show all the features we would expect of a social network from the literature, and from a design perspective. It is a social network, but it’s not a simple enough situation to just say that.<br><br>As an extension, some further research would be quite interesting. For example, given the data we have about interacting with the community correlating with perception of Steam as social media, maybe the mind-set could apply to the games they enjoy too? Are primarily single player gamers more focused on the store and vice versa for multiplayer gamers? It might also be interesting to look at average friend list numbers to see if they fit or come close to Dunbar’s number, which would heavily support Steam as a social network. Equally, looking at degrees of connection would be cool too: Milgram (1967) proposed that it takes at max six steps to connect each member of a social group with each other (or anyone to Kevin Bacon), and social media reflects that – Facebook was at 3-and-a-half-ish steps, Twitter reaches 3.44, LinkedIn operates at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree links… How many degrees exist between Steam users?<br><br>We can say that Steam is a social network by definition, and all users don’t have to know that it is for that to be the case, but it is looking at how Steam differs from other social platforms that can really tell us how unique it is as a store/network combo.</p>
