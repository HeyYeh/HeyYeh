                <p class="filmtext">
                    <h4><b>TL;DR</b></h4>
                    <ul class="filmtext">
                        <li>The Witcher 3 is built with good design practices from the ground up, letting them act as the back bone to not only the visual elements of the game (HUD, menus, etc.), but gameplay mechanics and how the player learns them too.</li><br>
                        <li>Cognitive load is avoided when it isn’t needed, pushed to the player when it enhances the gameplay experience, and, in cases of visual crowding, has been reduced through updates by the player sympathetic CD Projekt Red.</li><br>
                        <li>The Witcher 3 is a shining example of why player focused design is not something you add on to a finished product, but one of the foundational pillars of the final product as a whole.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

                    <p class="filmtext">At the time of writing this (admittedly over two years since the game’s release), The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt has literally won more Game of the Year awards than, well, anything else, and has been nominated (and won) a huge slew of other awards on top of that. I am currently very much in the middle of my first play through, so it would be short-sighted and premature of me to sing its praises now… But I’m going to anyway.<br><br>Why would I jump in enthusiastically at this point? Two reasons: first of all, being half way through (if I’m even close to that) in this game is still a lot of hours in, and, secondly, there is a very subtle psychology behind a lot of design choices, and it is beautiful in its user centric approach. So, while I won’t be talking about the fantastic story, remarkable voice acting, expertly crafted sound design and score, or any of the other things that I promised myself I wouldn’t gush about here, I will be trying to show how they tie in to that core principle of user design. What does this user design mean in the end product, though?<br><br>Immersion.<br><br>You see the word in reviews all the time, and there have been some attempts at measuring and defining it quantitatively with some success (Jennett, et al., 2008; Nack &amp; Lindley, 2008). User LionDev on Reddit even showed (with a very small sample size, true) that ‘immersion’ is an emotional quality that a lot of players associate with The Witcher 3. It is also pretty much always used to praise something, so there is some motivation for studios to make their games immersive from a fiscal standpoint if not an artistic one, but what does it mean at its core? Brown, and Cairns (2004) put it best: <br>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p class="mb-0"><i>“When you stop thinking about the fact that you’re playing a computer game and
you’re just in a computer”</i>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote><br>
                        <h4><b>Since when was thinking bad?</b></h4>
                        <p class="filmtext">Steve Krug, in his seminal work, <i>‘Don’t Make Me Think’</i>, highlights that a design that forces its user to problem-solve a solution is, pretty much, not great design. This book is geared towards web and mobile design, and it doesn’t perfectly apply to videogames: thinking in games is greatly encouraged at times, after all. What would Tetris be if you held ‘down’ and watched the blocks go where was optimal? What would Dark Souls be if you just tapped ‘A’ while every action and thought was made for you? Not making the player think is not the goal of a game designer, it’s not making the player think about anything but what’s important. It is freeing up cognitive resources so that the player can choose quickly between spells, movements, actions, and have fun while doing so, without having to focus on poorly displayed HUD elements that will get them killed, or navigating cluttered, confusing menus.<br><br>This idea of bogging down the players mind with irrelevant information and choices that they begrudgingly have to do (or will avoid) is known in the literature as ‘cognitive load ’ (Sweller, 1988). Good design, especially when that design is teaching something needs to reduce that fog of annoying steps and let users focus on what matters (Sweller, 1998). The Witcher 3 is basically a daunting, living encyclopaedia that players have to learn, and making that learning process nice is key in games like this.<br><br>Learning about the world and how to access it (gameplay, menu-ing, etc.) has to be done in a user friendly way then, and the most studied form of this (and the form you are probably most familiar with) is the tutorial, or the ‘worked example’ ( Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985; Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987; Sweller, 1988). The user is guided through the steps needed with instruction and then the instruction gradually fades away, leaving the user doing it all by themselves (Renkl, 2005). The main tutorial does this well, but unremarkably: you are guided through signs and actions and taught how to use them. Gwent, on the other hand, is a shining jewel of user friendliness. Compare it to, say, Fallout: New Vegas’ Caravan game. Caravan has a brisk, obscure tutorial, a cluttered and unclear (not to mention drab) UI; you are thrust in at the deep end, you get no sense of strategy, and you rely entirely on memory of what cards can do. It is more true to life, but it isn’t life, and it doesn’t need to be so hard to digest. Gwent offers descriptions, clear rules, clear outcomes, a clean interface that is clearly laid out, and there is a reason that it has its own standalone game today while Caravan is a faded memory. Fallout: New Vegas is pure gold though, please don’t think otherwise! <br><br>Tutorials are one thing, but how can a developer have any hope that players will actually use every sign, for example? Knowing that it’s there and needing or, more importantly, wanting to use it are very different things and, once again, The Witcher tackles it in stylish, user friendly fashion.

                        <h4><b>Features? Who needs ‘em?!</b></h4>
                        <p class="filmtext"><i>Don’t Make Me Think</i> also highlights that the average user of a system will almost always satisfice when presented with something. This means that they will go for the easiest possible option that meets the minimum requirements as a solution (a ‘heuristic’ or mental shortcut in psychology terms), but The Witcher 3’s action against this is fantastic. You see, it would be a very dull game if all you needed was the X button and igni (though you can play like this on the lowest difficulty). Instead, staying true to the fantastic lore that acts as the series’ spine, almost all combat options are a part of the world. They’re not an overload of choices that cause the player cognitive weight, they are, at least in the context of the game, common sense; the designers change what the easiest solution is to make deeper use of all the game’s features.<br><br>Let me give some examples to illustrate this, starting with your signs. Yrden, the big slowing circle, is kinda weak at the start of the game, and a little less satisfying to use than force push (aard) and flamethrower (igni), except when you are pushed to encounter your first Noonwraith in ‘Devil by the Well’. The Noonwraith is pretty much incorporeal, unhittable, until you draw out the fight or follow Geralt’s cues to use yrden. Taking it down becomes easy, satisfying, and you’ve internalised that information in a lore friendly way. The same can be said of learning about axii as the quick approach to shielded human enemies (or easier routes through some conversations), bombs and the crafting of them are crucial for monster nests, or, more dramatically, the crossbow’s effectiveness against flying enemies in the first true ‘boss fight’ with the griffin. Another lovely example is the fact that Witchers always use two swords, one steel and one silver based on the thing that requires cutting, and the best one for the job is drawn automatically when a fight starts to once again avoid unnecessary thought from the player (this can also be turned off, as a side note, as an option for deeper role playing). Better still, all of these examples teach you the variety of skills over a long period of time and one at a time which avoids overstimulation, another big cause of cognitive load.<br><br>In later areas and fights, you start to mix strategies and skills without realising it because you developed an understanding of the game naturally. You feel immersed, you feel like a Witcher, because you never had to think about acting like one.</p>
                        <h4><b>A little load here and there</b></h4>
                        <p class="filmtext">One of my favourite aspects of The Witcher 3’s approach to cognitive load though, is that they flood you with it and ease it onto you depending on the choices that you have to make. Sounds counter- intuitive, right?<br><br>Let’s start with the latter first though. Choice, in general, is pretty nice. Too much choice though and you start risking player dissatisfaction and, even sadder, avoidance of a game feature that your team spent literally months refining (Hafner, White, &amp; Handley, 2016; Iyengar &amp; Lepper, 2000). How can this be avoided when, for example, you have a robust crafting system that is steadily growing with more and more sword, armour, and potion schematics? Two ways, and they tie together quite nicely in this case to really give the best chance of getting the player interested. First of all, it has been shown that people are more likely to remain invested and push through the cognitive discomfort of excessive choice if they already have some investment in the thing (Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985). The second way is tying this crafting system into the quests of the game – something familiar to the player from other games, and something that many, many completionists out there will do anyway. The ‘treasure hunt’ missions for amazing Witcher gear are lore friendly (and very interesting if you read the notes at the locations), fun in a treasure hunt-y kind of way, and won’t reach the point where crafting is really urged until after a big time investment is already made.<br><br>I will be the first to admit that this is a slightly… Flawed approach, however. In the Witcher 3’s case, I loved hunting down the schematics, I loved crafting them, I loved the fact that they allow you to buy missing items from the crafting menu (since patch 1.2, but we’ll talk about that later), but… The Witcher gear is almost too good. Maybe my opinion will change when I double my playtime, but, as of now, I was eased into crafting one set of armour (and upgrading it), and other crafting options just didn’t seem necessary. It should be noted that this is not avoidance, and doesn’t seem to be cognitive load, it is just unfortunate that the system that guides players into crafting also works to make it redundant. From a lore perspective, this makes sense and shouldn’t be changed, but some other way of making those other schematics useful would be nice. Perhaps being eased into those weaker schematics beforehand? A quest where a villager needs a golden cudgel which only a very specific, very open-minded, smithy will make? The weapon is useless to the player, but unique, and this route might just open them up to crafting other schematic weapons before the Witcher gear comes into play.<br><br>With that weak slap of criticism off my chest, I want to talk about my favourite psychological tool that The Witcher 3 uses: deliberate cognitive loading in decision making. Much like TellTale Games’ games (also very interesting from a user experience perspective, but that’s for another day) forced cognitive load instances between two harrowing choices make for memorable experiences that can last years through a mechanism called the peak-end rule. This is a fairly robust phenomenon whereby a person will judge an experience based on its peak (the most intense point - videogames can have many peaks, and these aren’t limited to just choices), and its end rather than the sum of many small moments (Kahneman, et al., 1993). Paired with the fact that emotional (peak) moments are naturally better encoded into our memory (Hamann, 2001), we have an explanation for why this game is spoken about fondly by people who completed it months ago. Unsurprisingly, this is also essentially the basis of nostalgia (Wildschutm et al., 2006) which is wholly deserving of its own post within games. For The Witcher though, should I mention the spirit in the tree?<br><br>And why can the developers get away with pushing these heavy decisions to players now and then? Because it’s fun, and they’re well written… Oh, and they smooth everything else out so nicely! Redundant mental effort is cut away, and what’s left is GOTY material. Heck, even the user interface is geared towards control and immersion…</p>
                        <h4><b>The user interface; control and immersion</b></h4>
                        <p class="filmtext">Before I dive into my main couple of points for this section, I did want to throw some praise to something that isn’t really mentioned too much: the reactive HUD. Ages ago, a mod for the first version of Skyrim (before it was being ported to every console/home appliance under the sun) was created by Nexus user Gopher called ‘Immersive HUD’. Simply put, it made it so that every HUD element (compass, health, etc.) just disappeared when they weren’t needed, letting you take in the beauty of Skyrim with even less distraction. As much as I love Skyrim, The Witcher 3 is a decidedly prettier game, and the use of the same immersive HUD system is very much appreciated – once again, the designers take away clutter from your periphery and mind, letting you focus on what you should be focusing on – like understanding cheese based magic.<br><br>With that out of the way, let me briefly talk about how the menu system is subtly wonderful. Yes, the menu system: it deserves love too, especially because it yet again keeps cognitive load down in an understated fashion. When you press start, not only are the options chunked down into 7 simple categories (another tactic for making it less initially intimidating to players), but they are arranged based on the expected frequency that you will be using each category. Your cursor starts on the ‘Map’ option – the option most players will use most frequency – followed by ‘Inventory’ and ‘Quests’, both frequently used for updating equipment and goals respectively. ‘Alchemy’ and ‘Character’ come next, sensibly; you craft less than you equip, and you level up less frequently than you complete quests. ’Glossary’ and ‘Meditation’ sit at the edges with their fringe uses, but I think a visual demonstration is always nice. In Figure 1, you can see simple frequency plot of each time observed players (3 of my friends) used each option in a roughly 3-ish hour total period of playtime. Participants were already familiar with the game, and each were ignorant of the… Okay, look, I know it’s bad science but this is an anecdotal display for lack of a participant body, okay? Just… Just look at the graph…</p>

                        <img class="img-responsive articlesubimage" src="../../Stuff/ArticleImages/Witcher3Graph.png" />
                        <p class="filmtext"><i>Figure 1 – Bar graph showing normal distribution of menu option usage, averaged across three participants playing for a roughly three hour period.</i><br><br>My final point here is focused on the actual UI of the game, and it is a good time to acknowledge that this had its flaws in the initial release. The inventory screen itself was not categorised at all, which led to not only visual overload, but another form of choice overload too: prowling through Geralt’s deep pockets to find a single quest item (a searching task). The new, chunked version is practically and psychologically significantly nicer (Mogilner, Rudnick, &amp; Iyengar, 2008).Patch 1.2 really was a fantastic change, even allowing you to read books as soon as you picked them up instead of searching through your inventory (cognitively heavy task; Paas, Renkl, &amp; Sweller, 2010). I would like to discuss the adrenaline bar specifically though, and this received frustrated web posts from players, and a direct point of concern from PlayerResearch.co.uk: not only is the adrenaline meter small and surrounded by other key UI elements, it was directly at risk of crowding due to sharing geometric features with those elements (the curve in this case; Levi, 2008). As you can see in Figure 2, the update improved the size and, by giving it a ‘filling up’ effect, made it easier to see how many points of adrenaline you had at a glance. But crowding is still a slight problem…<br><br>Or is it?<br><br>With the changes from patch 1.2 making it more visually clear, I would like to argue against crowding having much impact now in general. Instead, it is kind of victim to a separate issue… It isn’t really explained in any depth until players start obtaining the high level (very fun) skills that use it, but it still has use long before this. In the early game, adrenaline points act as damage buffs... Okay, not a huge deal, which is why this lack of early information is kinda good and kinda bad, but I do think it’s mainly good. The bad is that information is always nice, but the good is that by the time you need to keep an eye on how many adrenaline points you have, you’ve already been glancing at health, stamina, and toxicity for hours. You have become somewhat of an expert in it, not to mention your experience of doing so in other games; expertise seems to mediate the problem of crowding quite nicely, as shown by Wong, &amp; Gauthier (2012) by observing musicians of expert and novice skill level at reading sheet music, a medium where the sheer amount of notes naturally causes visual crowding.

                        <h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
                        <p class="filmtext">As I said at the start of this post, The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is truly an encyclopaedia of a game. Expertly crafted, artistically striking, and wonderfully user oriented. It is an amazing example of slurred tutorialisation in a lore friendly way, in a way that makes its lessons stick, and, in a way that doesn’t cause the player untold confusion or cognitive load. It’s not perfect of course, but it is an amazing example of how utilising user oriented design practices from the very start of development enhances the final experience. It isn’t the only reason that this game won so many awards, but by God is it a contributing one.</p>
