            <div class="heading">Etymology, mythology, and BBC's Sherlock</div>
            <div class="miniTitle">12 minute read time - grab a cup of tea and biscuits while you read</div>
            <div class="subheading">Intro</div>
            <div class="paragraph"><i>Disclaimer: If you haven‚Äôt seen season 4 of the BBC‚Äôs Sherlock yet, I would recommend not reading this post. If, however, you have seen it, or you just love a bit of language, read on!</i></div>

            <div class="paragraph">So, in the final two episodes of season 4, we became acquainted with Sherlock‚Äôs long lost(-ish) sister, Eurus. In some ways though, this is not the first we‚Äôve heard of her. The showrunners freely admit that... Okay, I'll be honest. I just want to talk about niche Greek Gods and how they've contributed to modern words.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">Humour me.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">In Greek mythology Eurus is one of the Anemoi, wind gods who each personified a cardinal direction of the compass. They had their own personalities, and their own associations with various seasons and weathers. Don't give them a big head though, they're not that special.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">Wind gods are not uncommon in any mythological pantheon, though not that many non-Greek ones contributed to our common language. Kamikaze, for example, derives from ‚Äòkami‚Äô (‚Äòdivine), and ‚Äòkaze‚Äô (‚Äòwind‚Äô) in Japanese - sounds like a god right? In reality, this probably refers to a typhoon (admittedly sent by Gods) that saved Japan from Mongol invasion in 1281.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">Some other wind Gods include Ehecatl, who was a huge feathered serpent from the Aztecs; Shu (‚Äúhe who rises up‚Äù) who was the calm and collected personification of air itself in Egypt; Vayu who rides an incredibly quick gazelle in Hindyu mythology, and there are many more beyond these.</div>
            
            <div class="articleImage"><img id="articleImage" src="https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/thumb/a/a4/Cyclos.png/1200px-Cyclos.png">
                <div class="imageSubtext">And don't even get me started on fictional wind gods!</div>
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">It‚Äôs not overly surprising that so many Gods of wind exist either; it‚Äôs not exactly a new concept, and, just like with that kamikaze example above, it's a huge part of the world that can save or destroy lives.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">Wind is so tangible too, even more so than other Godly concepts like the seasons or the hunt; you really feel the wind, which we can even see in adjectives associated with it. ‚ÄòCutting‚Äô, ‚Äòbiting‚Äô, ‚Äògentle‚Äô, ‚Äòforceful‚Äô, ‚Äòsharp‚Äô, ‚Äòwild‚Äô... </div>
                
                <div class="paragraph">Just a walk in the park on a windy winter night makes you think of little else other than wind, so it makes sense that ancient civilisations would personify it as this all-present godly thing. They don‚Äôt have the data that we have about weather patterns or physics, so ‚Äúwhen it can‚Äôt be named, ascribe it to the Gods‚Äù (Steiner, 2009).</div>

            <div class="subheading">The Anemoi</div>

            <div class="paragraph">The tower of winds in Athens depicts eight wind Gods in total, but, for brevity‚Äôs sake and because they have more recognisable contributions to modern language (and modern Sherlock), we will focus on the four depicted in Homer‚Äôs poems.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">So that you can conjure up a pretty picture of them, they were generally portrayed as either winged men who lived together in a cavern in Mount Haimos, or horses who lived on the island of Aiolia. For the former, imagine male harpies (the Anemoi and harpies are said to have mated and created immortal horses too), and for the latter, imagine horses‚Ä¶</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">So let's jump into the actual Gods...</div>
            
            <div class="subheading">Boreas</div>

            <div class="paragraph">The bringer of winter, holder of a violent temper. Father of two of the Argonauts, a Goddess of snow (Chione), and many horses who can charge across a field without even trampling the crops. He fell in love with the daugher of the king of Athens, Oreithia. When she didn't really respond to his flirting, he just went and kidnapped her. Nice guy.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">He is the North wind, and he contributes his name to what we know as The Northern Lights: Aurora Borealis. There is some debate over who first used that term, especially considering ‚ÄòAurora‚Äô seems to refer to the Roman Goddess of the dawn while Boreas is a Greek God.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">It should be noted that the Greeks did know about the Northern lights, but described them in much cooler terms like ‚Äòblazing skies‚Äô, or ‚Äòflaming sky dragons‚Äô. The hybridisation does indicate that it is a term that came long after the Greeks anyway, most likely in the 1600s. quite possibly in 1621 more specifically, by a man named Pierre Gassendi in his treatise titled ‚ÄòPhysics‚Äô, but that is waaaaay off track for this post.</div>

                <div class="imageSubtext">Boreas being an arse and kidnapping Oreithia</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subheading">Zephyrus</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">The gentle bringer of the spring, father of Achilles‚Äô two horses. He created the hyacinth flower from the blood of a handsome man of the same name after he murdered him with a discus, had sex with a rainbow (Iris) and fathered the Goddess of love (Eros).</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">He is the West wind, and gives his name to the uncommon, but nice, word ‚Äòzephyr‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòa soft breeze‚Äô. Why a soft breeze, you might ask? I have no idea! But it has been used as far back as Chaucer‚Äôs days, often in a eulogising fashion; in the Canterbury Tales, he describes the God as having ‚Äòswete breeth‚Äô, as one source of that soft breeze meaning.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">It seems to have been big William Shakespeare himself that thrust it into more common use though, writing in his play Cymbelline:</div>
            
            <div class="quote">‚ÄòThou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon'st<br>In these two princely boys! They are as gentle<br>As zephyrs blowing below the violet.'</div>

            <div class="articleImage" style="margin-top: 20px;"><img id="articleImage" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FLWWDgtE2bU/VOG8ehOfyjI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/AQt4P4GMGjc/s1600/zpage018.gif">
                <div class="imageSubtext">Zephyrus accidentally killing Hyacinth, feat. large horn</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subheading">Notos</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">The bringer of late summer storms, the killer of crops, the southern wind, and‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs kind of all the character building he gets.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">Every mention I have found so far has been about how he is either just sort of hanging out, or being a bit of an arse; he brought rain down on the Argonauts that Zephyrus froze and turned to hail, he is a ‚Äòfoe to tree and crop and herd‚Äô, and he, along with Eurus, was around when Lucifer the Morning Star ‚Äòrevealed the shining day‚Äô.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">I don‚Äôt think ‚ÄòNotos‚Äô itself led to any modern terms, but the Roman name of the same God, ‚ÄòAuster‚Äô, does seem to have led to ‚ÄòAustralia‚Äô (essentially ‚ÄòSouthern ‚Äì Land‚Äô). Before that, Australia was called ‚ÄòNew Holland‚Äô by a Dutch seafarer called Abel Tasaman, but, again, that is a whole other story...</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">So yeah, not the most thrilling of wind deities...Sorry about that.</div>
            
            <div class="articleImage" style="margin-top: 20px;"><img id="articleImage" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/greekmythology/images/a/a3/9858269_orig.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160115102709">
                <div class="imageSubtext">Notos chillin'</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subheading">Eurus</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">And, finally, we reach the East wind. Eurus is generally associated with Autumn, lived near the palace of Helios (the sun God) in the far east (where the sun rises), and, again, there‚Äôs not much else to say.</div>
            
            <div class='paragraph'>There are, however, a lot of places on the internet that say that Eurus was an unlucky wind, which would support the foreboding line in Sherlock that ‚Äòan east wind is blowing‚Äù. There are no good Greek sources that I have found to support it, but there are ways that it makes sense.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">Eurus is the least spoken about of the four main Anemoi after all, and the warm winds that he pushes around often seem overshadowed by his blustery brothers or his, admittedly pretty cool neighbour, Helios. There is some slightly more reasonable guesses that the ‚Äòunlucky east wind‚Äô might have been used as a metaphor for the destruction that World War I brought upon the world, though, which would not even necessarily be derived from the Greek God at all.</div>
            
            <div class="subheading">Why was she called Eurus then?</div>

            <div class="paragraph">While I‚Äôve been forced to move away from Greek mythology, there is still one source that might explain the use of the East wind in the show‚Ä¶ The writer did it! Not the show writers though, sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself in his short Sherlock story ‚ÄòHis Last Bow‚Äô. This was written in 1917, at a point when the war metaphor of the wind would be fresh in people‚Äôs minds, and is, in fact, about Sherlock‚Äôs own service in the Great War. The story ends as follows:</div>

            <div class="quote" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15pt; line-height: normal">The two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes, recalling once again the days of the past, while their prisoner vainly wriggled to undo the bonds that held him. As they turned to the car Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head.<br>"There's an east wind coming, Watson."<br>"I think not, Holmes. It is very warm."<br>"Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age. There's an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it's God's own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared. Start her up, Watson, for it's time that we were on our way. I have a check for five hundred pounds which should be cashed early, for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it if he can."</div>

            <div class="paragraph">Considering all of the promotional material and material within the show that suggests the writers and producers went with the ‚Äòunlucky, rain bringer‚Äô interpretation (regardless of whether they went with the Greek or historical context to start with), why in all heck did Sherlock‚Äôs parents name Eurus after that figure?</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">It is established that the mother is a genius, so it‚Äôs hard to imagine that she would be entirely unaware of the myth or war origin (or she was fully aware of the actual interpretation of the warm easterly winds and it‚Äôs the writers that missed the memo).</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">After all, the name Sherlock seems to simply be an old fashioned name referring to hair (either ‚Äòclosely cut hair‚Äô ‚Äì ‚Äòshear ‚Äì lock‚Äô, or bright coloured hair; ‚Äòbright-lock‚Äô ‚Äì ‚Äòscir-lock‚Äô), and Mycroft seems to break down to ‚Äòm√Ω√∞e‚Äô (‚Äòthe mouth of a stream‚Äô or ‚Äòthe function of water‚Äô) and ‚Äòcroft‚Äô (‚Äòenclosed field‚Äô); essentially referring to farming with water.</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">There‚Äôs no precedence in the names for unlucky or bad things then. Mycroft is named after the nurturing and hardworking nature of farming, and Sherlock‚Ä¶ Well, Sherlock has hair, so why did Eurus get the short end of the stick? Hell, both Sherlock and Mycroft are old English names too, while Eurus is Greek, so why, oh why did the poor girl get labelled the black sheep of the family from day one? The character herself says that her parents ‚Äòliked silly names‚Äô, but, first of all, those other two aren‚Äôt all that silly as we‚Äôve explored, and they labelled her as bad news from the start rather than calling her ‚Äòhardworking‚Äô or‚Ä¶ ‚Äòhair owning‚Äô.</div>
            
            <div class="subheading">Closing thoughts</div>

            <div class="paragraph">I‚Äôd like to end this with a thought‚Ä¶ In psychology, there is a long standing debate between nature (the biological foundation of a person determining who they are and what they do), and nurture (the way a person is raised and socialised influencing who they are and what they do).</div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">Can we blame the child born with a unique level of intelligence for their actions, for their wrongdoings, when they were told that they were bad from the start? Imagine a young girl, bright-eyed, cheerful, addicted to books and learning about the first World War. Imagine her face dropping as she sees her name, sees the phrase that her dear mother used to coo her to sleep‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòEast wind‚Äô... And realising that that sweet mother actually sees her as the start of a war that tore a world apart. She reads about the devastation, the suffering, and she is forced to equate herself to it‚Ä¶ In her own mind, she knows herself as nothing but a villain.</div>

            <div class='paragraph'>Or the show writers thought that it was cool, I don‚Äôt know... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</div>

            <div class="paragraph"><i>Post-disclaimer: as is the nature with anything based around mythology, there are multiple general interpretations and ideas. The ones above are not definitively right by definition, but they might be mildly interesting and mildly correct enough to make someone go ‚Äòoh, cool‚Äô or ‚Äòright‚Ä¶‚Äô.</i></div>
