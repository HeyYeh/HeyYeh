                <h4>This video was a rare situation where a band wanted to be funny in their video, so we did a mild parody of the arty pretentious videos that were popular at the time. The video shows five artsy situations (one for each band member) and follows them as they slowly descend to chaos. Below is the treatment for one of these scenarios, and the actual video that we made.</h4> <br>

                <img class="responsive penguinBreak1" src="Page-Break-1.png" /><br><br>

                <p class="filmtext"><u class="penguinItalics">Foxy’s Big Meal</u><br><br>A lot of rap music videos lately show the artist at an elaborate feast of beautiful food, dressed like a king and not even touching their meal. We think that’s an artsy pile of wank, so Foxy is going to bring a little bit of reality to the concept.<br><br><i>Set-up shots</i><br><br>Our opening shots of this section will show Foxy sat at a table for one, dressed in a suit and top hat as if ready for his first (only?) posh meal ever. The table will be decorated nicely, and the model, dressed as a waitress for these scenes, will pour wine into a glass that he holds out to her. He doesn’t look at her while he does this, regardless of how much he wants to.<br><br>We will have a couple of shots of Foxy sipping wine, laying his napkin over his lap, and generally preparing for his meal, which will lead us into the next section...<br><br><i>The next section - Starters and Main</i><br><br>In those rap videos, the table is laid out with glistening roast hog, bowls of fruit, and every kind of finger food you could imagine. However, Foxy is a man of the people, so he shall eat the food of the people -- Greasy takeaway presented in a slightly better way.<br><br>For the starter, he will be brought a silver platter of a McDonalds burger cut into cubes and served on toothpicks, because <i>anything</i> on a toothpick is classy. He will take a good look at the dish, eating it with his eyes, then will pick up one of the cubes and shove the whole thing in his mouth at once.<br><br>He’ll chew with appreciation.<br><br>For the main course he will be presented with a kebab and chips, unwrapped with all of the ingredients presented as nicely as possible (emphasis on ‘as possible). He will start eating it with a knife and fork like the civilised gent that he is, but then remove the napkin from his lap and start going at it with his hands, eating it sloppily (like the gent that he <i>actually</i> is).<br><br><i>Pudding - The big finale</i><br><br>For dessert the model will place a nice chocolate cake in front of Foxy then offer a cake slice to let him cut it neatly. Foxy will refuse.<br><br>The model will lean in and squirt just a little bit of whipped cream on top of the cake, but Foxy looks at her with disgust. He grabs the whipped cream from her hands and squirts tons of it onto the cake and into his own mouth before diving into his dessert like an animal. It gets everywhere, over his hands, his clothes, his face, and eventually he feels sick…<br><br>He leans forward and starts throwing up multi-coloured bubbles right into the dish.</p>

                <img class="responsive penguinBreak1" src="Page-Break-1.png" />

                <p class="filmtext"><u class="penguinItalics">Femme Fatale bed seduction</u><br><br>The Femme Fatale will be in the bed she shared with the Boyfriend in the fantasy sex scene, but this time alone, being seductive and alluring. As before, there will be hints of murder, in this case with blood dripping from her fingers as she tries to draw an unseen person to her. Again, pairing her character with the idea of murder like this helps intensify the fear that it might really happen, but also help the audience see Savanna’s perspective - this is very much the image that Savanna may have of her after all: a seductress who is at real risk of her Boyfriend’s anger…<br><br><i>Alternative 1
                    </i><br><br>This scene will show the Femme Fatale in bed, acting seductively and trying to draw some unseen person to her. There will be hints of murder here too, blood possibly dripping from her fingers as she gestures someone over, which ties together the cause and effect of her story: the Femme Fatale was seductive to the wrong person, and she is likely to suffer for it…<br><br><i>Alternative 2
                    </i><br><br>Showing the Femme Fatale relaxing in bed and seducing some unseen person, including those hints at murder again (blood dripping from her fingers could be good here), pairs the act of her seducing with the consequences: murder.<br><br><br><u class="penguinItalics">Savanna performing to mirror - other characters appear in reflection</u><br><br>Savanna will be performing to a reflection of herself in the mirror, showing the emotion of the song. After a few moments, the Femme Fatale and the Boyfriend appear in that reflection too, watching her sing. This places Savanna in the middle of the conflict, showing how she is telling the story and sharing her view and fears through the lyrics of the song. It almost seems like she is thinking it all through herself too, trying to understand how all of this happened and what she should do next.<br><br><i>Alternative </i><br><br>In this shot, Savanna performs into a mirror, with the Femme Fatale and the boyfriend appearing behind her after a few moments. This puts her in the centre of the conflict, and displays visually that we are following Savanna’s perspective throughout the song.

Fun fact number one: half of the dialogue in the script was actually written without the letter 'a' -- It was plot relevant, I'm not just showing off (I'm showing off a little though.)

                        <li class="dialogue">THE WRITER begins to question his own sanity as he tentatively takes the kettle off the heat. He returns to the desk, looking confused, nervous, and reluctant. There is a clear conflict in him, part of him wanting to stop but some strange compulsion to keep writing holds him in place.

He shuts his eyes and his jaw tightens, still typing as a dull throbbing pain grows in the centre of his skull. It quickly becomes a horrible aching. Aching. Aching. Aching. ---</li>
                        <li class="action">THE WRITER stops typing suddenly when the ‘A’ key jams. The coat drags coins to the floor, the sound making THE WRITER jump and look back. After a moment, he turns back to his work and tries to press the key a few times with no success.</li>

On the other side of the room, the tin of coins previously sitting still gets pulled to the ground, spilling out. THE WRITER jumps, turning to check it. He fixes his eyes on it, thinking, before turning to resume writing. THE WRITER tries to press the stuck key numerous times, with no success. He persists in typing, but he begins to look frightened, his fingers still moving fitfully over the typewriter, seemingly out of his control.</li>
                        <li class="action">Muscles tense as this inner fear grows and grows. After a few moments, a stack of books fall, the top one shutting hard.</li>

He seems flustered by this, suddenly very conscious of the concept of endings, of stopping, of the people in such ended stories. He looks to his former successes sorrowfully now, wondering whether his purpose in the world is truly done. His muscles tense. He feels truly powerless in deciding his next movements himself: stop typing, succumb, or continue typing endlessly?</li>

                <h4>This was a collaborative project set-up by me and a friend where four writers and four directors made a quarter of an overall story exploring one theme in pairs. The idea here was that books are drugs in this world, and it was a lot of fun to write. Sadly, I have two unfortunate facts though: this one died in pre-production, and, most sad of all, that title was only my temporary placeholder name - the other writers weren't so behind it...</h4> <br>

                    <li class="action">The room becomes more surreal as his senses get more sensitive; colours dance in the air, he hears his fingers scrape and crunch the paper, and the sound of an insect across the room feels like a marching band beside his head.</li>
                    <li class="action">He swallows again; it looks painful, but he quickly tears and balls another page and starts chewing that too, faster now.</li>

                    <li class="action">The world is bright and nice through his eyes but he looks desperate in reality, sad, and a bit weird.</li>
                    <li class="action">THE LIBRARIAN backs away in the background, watching.</li>
                    <li class="action">THE MAN seems possessed, ripping into the pages, desperate to eat, desperate for that higher high.</li>

                    <li class="action">Sweat builds on his head, bending forward, cheeks flushing as he chews and swallows.</li>
                    <li class="action">A hand on his stomach, one final swallow, eyes widening as he realises what’s about to happen.</li>

                <h4>During a brief four month period of band management, I helped to orchestrate a bunch of things. These included a PR campaign with the the harmonica player from Karma Chameleon, commissioning a new logo, photoshoots, and social media events like the below to give a little more interaction with the audience.</h4> <br>

                <h4>During the production of a music video showing a band being kidnapped by a doppelganger, I pushed for an interesting social media campaign in which the band's accounts were 'blacked out'. They would change their cover photo and band image to dark, cryptic pictures, and would gradually make them more obviously kidnapping photos as the release date approached. They could have also posted ransom note type posts, all to build hype for the single and video. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. Their manager was not happy about it first of all, and then the band broke up just before they released the video. That second one was probably the bigger issue...</h4> <br>

                <h4>Just in case you thought that I was holding back some of the weirder ideas from you (or if you were starting to think I was okay at Photoshop) I thought I'd put this one in here. This is a pretty surreal concept where we follow a few 80s style porn scenes but, when it reaches a point where undressing would usually occur, a small green person in a bodysuit jumps out of their trousers and causes chaos. This would either be a music video, or some kind of progressive contraceptive advert...</h4> <br>

                <h4>This concept is still in very early stages, so a lot can change before I develop it into an actual thing. While it's Sci-Fi right now, I don't imagine it will get any more Sci-Fi than Black Mirror -- a sort of dark, otherness where it is obviously fantasy but unsettlingly relatable. In this one, humans have discovered or engineered a pet that allows them to experience all emotion by proxy through it. Want to enjoy the chemical pleasure of chocolate without the risk of diabetes or weight gain? Feed the pet! Want to enjoy the thrill of being drunk without later dehydration and hangovers? Your pet can have those! Want to dabble in something heavier? Well, guess what...?</h4> <br>

                <h4>Another vague concept which I haven'd picked a form for just yet. This one would follow a very trendy, happy girl who lives in a shed in the forest -- a well decorated shed, mind -- who ventures into a nearby city, befriends people, and robs them of family photos for a shrine in her home so that she can seek a life she doesn't have. Stylistically I imagine it to be similar to <i>The End of the F***ing World</i>, but nothing is set in stone.</h4> <br>

                <h4>As I started these film projects in a broadly stressful part of my life, and by the nature of the industry, it quickly became clear that organisation would make or break a production. This spreadsheet was put together and is adapted based on the project, including more tabs and boxes depending on the needs of the shoot. The great thing about Google Sheets is that we can share it with every member of the cast and crew and they can update it, check it for details they need, keep track of budgets, and it becomes a sort of living callsheet. Google advertisements aside, I quickly made this blank one for your viewing pleasure, so I would be happy to show you more about it if you want to see it.</h4> <br>
