  <h3>Welcome, Adventurer!</h3>

  <p>You are reading the web version of a choose your own adventure book, you lucky thing.</p>
  <p>My wife and I often read gamebooks in the Fighting Fantasy series together, and those pioneering stories were one of my first tastes of the weird and wonderful world of RPGs.</p>
  <p>This gamebook specifically is heavily inspired by the fantastic boardgame The Mystic Wood, created by Terence Peter Donnelly. It's a game of exploration, steeped in Arthurian legend, where you play as 1 of 7 heroes each with their own quest to complete. My partner loves this game, so if you encounter a reference you don't quite get, it's probably either a Mystic Wood allusion or an in-joke between us.</p>
  <p>One day, I will work in proper RPG functionality to this web version. For now, I encourage you to use a physical pen, paper, and dice. Track your stats and inventory, draw a map, go nuts. But, if you're anything like me, you'll read this like a book 9 times out of 10 and ignore the RPG elements. Don't worry, I won't tell on you.</p>
  <p>To skip the rules explanation and jump to the story, click here: <strong><a href="#Background">Background</a></strong></p>
  <p>Click any <strong>bold and underlined</strong> text to take you to that reference.</p>
  <p>To go back to the previous reference, use the <strong>back function</strong> in your browser.</p>

<h1 id="characterCreation">CHARACTER CREATION</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Before embarking on your adventure, you must first create your character
        by deciding your Stats, Class, and starting Feats. These three elements
        will be explained below and then you will find instructions on how to
        create your hero after.
      </p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Heroes are defined by three key characteristics:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<b> PROWESS </b>
        - This reflects your skill in combat, whether that be the deftness of
        your blade arm or the potency of your magic. This stat directly impacts
        how often you will strike your foes, and the damage you will deal upon
        them.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<b> CONSTITUTION </b>
        - Your hardiness, stamina, and fortitude. This stat defines your total
        maximum health.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<b> CHARISMA </b>
        - Your skills at persuasion and creating trust from thin air. The
        denizens of the Mystic Wood are less likely to attack strangers they
        like, and they're more likely to provide clues or equipment as well.
      </p>
<h2>Class</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Heroes come in two forms:
        <b> WARRIORS </b>
        , and
        <b> WIZARDS </b>
        .
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        WARRIORS are experts in martial combat. They are fast, precise, and
        wield weaponry like extensions of their own arms. Their Feats largely
        focus around dealing and sustaining greater amounts of damage.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        WIZARDS are beings who are tapped into the magic underlying all life.
        They have the rare gift of manipulating those arcane threads to create
        elements from thin air, or to discombobulate foes. Their Feats generally
        focus around using magical energy to gain unconventional advantages in
        combat.
      </p>
<h2>Feats</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        A
        <b> FEAT </b>
        is a heroic ability that has been awakened inside you. These can take
        the form of magical spells, a deep knowledge of a subject, or an act of
        physical strength or dexterity that few can perform.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Each class has a set of Feats that they can learn, but only start with
        knowledge of very few. Heroes can earn more feats throughout this
        adventure, if they can awaken the power inside them that is...
      </p>
<h2>Assigning stats</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        To create your character, you must first decide your starting skill
        levels. You have
        <b> 30 POINTS </b>
        to distribute between your PROWESS, CONSTITUTION, and CHARISMA stats.
        You could create a balanced hero by equally distributing these points
        between the three, or specialise your hero in one or the other. Either
        route is entirely viable.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You may also define these initial stats by rolling a D20 for each one,
        but be wary of entering the forest as a hero too weak or indeed too
        powerful.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        For your Constitution, double the value you assign to it and mark that
        down as your hero's starting maximum health. When recovering your health
        throughout the adventure, you may never exceed this number except in the
        rare cases where the text specifies you may.
      </p>
<h2>Choosing a class</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You must next choose the class of hero you would like to play as.
        Broadly, WARRIORS will excel in fighting enemies and WIZARDS will have
        access to a variety of skills that will benefit them outside of combat
        more so than in combat.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        If you have chosen a Warrior, you may start your adventure with an Axe
        (+1 Prowess), Sword (+1 Constitution), or Pair of Daggers (+1 Charisma).
        You may find other weapons or armour in your travels but remember that
        you only gain the benefits of the one you are wielding.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        If you have chosen a Wizard, you must have a Focus in order to use most
        magic. A Focus is much like a wand and allows you to direct magical
        energy. You may start with an Oak Focus (+1 Prowess), a Redwood Focus
        (+1 Constitution), or a Walnut Focus (+1 Charisma). As above, you may
        find other Focusi or armour on your travels, but you only gain the
        benefits of what you are using. By default, your Focus deals damage
        through ranged blasts of energy.
      </p>
<h2>Feats</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Warriors and Wizards have a different pool of feats to choose from.
        Based on the class you chose, refer to the relevant table below and pick
        TWO abilities to enter this adventure with. You may choose these
        randomly by rolling a D20 twice, or you may choose more or fewer Feats
        if you would like to mix up future adventures into these woods.
      </p>
<h2>Skill checks</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Throughout your adventure, you will be asked to roll against one of your
        stats to determine if you succeed or fail certain tasks. To do this,
        roll a D20 and if the result is equal to or less than the stat being
        tested, then you succeed. If you roll a number greater than the value of
        your stat, you have failed that test.
      </p>

<h1>Advice on Adventuring</h1>
<h2 id="combat">Fighting Denizens</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        When you enter into combat, you must resolve the fight as
        described below. First, note your opponent's Prowess and Health in your
        adventuring notes to track how they may change throughout the battle.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        0. Note any feats that you may want to use in this battle, and when you
        are able to use them.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        1. Roll a D20 for your opponent and add its Prowess to that number. This
        is your foe's Attack Strength.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        2. Roll a D20 for yourself and add your Prowess to that number. This is
        your Attack Strength.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        3. The combatant with the higher number gets a strike in, and the
        difference between the two numbers is the amount of damage dealt. If
        both numbers are the same, then you have parried each other’s attacks
        and no damage is dealt. Combat continues from step 1 above.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        4. Subtract the damage dealt from the health stat of the combatant that
        lost the round of combat.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        5. Begin the next Attack Round, starting again at step 1. This flow
        repeats until either you or your opponent reach 0 health (death).
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        If you are killed, you may either retry the battle from its initial values
        or deny yourself mercy and start your adventure again using a new
        character.
      </p>
<h2>Provisions and Recovering Health</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        There are two types of Provision that you will find on your adventure:
        items of Food, and Full Rations.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        An item of Food on its own is not enough to provide a filling meal, but
        6 food items is more substantial. A bundle of 6 food items is considered
        a Ration, but it is recommended that you track food you find in Food
        Items rather than Rations.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        At any time that you feel safe to do so, you may eat a portion of
        Rations and recover 4 health. You may eat as many portions as you like
        per rest but must deduct 6 Food Items from your total for each Ration
        that you eat.
      </p>
<h2>Loot</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Throughout your adventure you will have the opportunity to explore the
        hiding places of the forest, and perhaps the pockets of those you fell.
        At times, you will be told that you find some number of COMMON,
        UNCOMMON, or RARE loot. In order to discover exactly what you find, turn
        to the back of the book and roll against the loot tables there. For each
        table, roll a D20 and divide the result by 2, rounding down, then add
        the corresponding item to your inventory.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        For weapons and potions obtained from the loot tables, you can only
        obtain them once. If you roll that item again, you may re-roll until you
        find something else.
      </p>
<h3>
<img src="ActualImages/Staff_Final.png">
</img></h3>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        As an adventurer, your equipment is your lifeline. The right weapon or
        headgear could save your life in the direst of circumstances, but
        remember this: you can only have one weapon or piece of armour equipped
        at a time, and you may not switch equipment during a battle. Try to
        anticipate the challenges ahead of you and change equipment in the calm
        before the storm.
      </p>
<h1 id="Background">Background</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You are one of the last existing Bunnyborn: creatures descended from the
        Palapin, a race of hyper-intelligent rabbits that hopped and thrived in
        the wilderness long ago. When humans entered their lands, tension
        followed. One species sought to maintain nature and
        the other to bend it to their will, and yet a pact of peace was formed on the foundation of mutual respect. The humans envied the
        Palapin's magical prowess, and the Palapin admired the human sense of
        adventure and courage. Through potent Palapin magic, the Bunnyborn were
        created as a combination of each species' best traits.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        The Palapin disappeared from the world long ago, with no clear reason as
        to why. No known threat scared them away, no known war wiped them out.
        The only clue as to what happened is the tale of one farmer boy, who
        described a great migration of bunnies skyward, towards the brightest
        moon he had ever seen.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        The Bunnyborn remained but were few in number. Without the Palapin,
        their wilderness home felt cold and empty and so they became a nomadic
        species. They travelled the land in search of their Palapin ancestors,
        seeking out adventure wherever it may be found.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        It is a rite of passage in Bunnyborn societies to leave the herd when
        you come of age, only to return when you have a great adventure to
        tell - for the one thing Bunnyborn enjoy more than adventure is tales of
        it.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You came of age some months ago and have been journeying since. Your
        natural agility has served you well on your hikes, traversing over
        mountains and plains with an incredible diversity of terrain in between. But, 
        despite your keen hearing and eyesight, there has been no adventure to
        behold, and any human settlement you find greets you with uncertainty
        from adults and excitable cuddling from the younglings.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        But that changed in the small town of Middleturf. You were stretched out
        on your back, basking in the warm sun, when a woman approached
      . She was middle-aged, with a hood wrapped tight around her head and a look of
        abject sadness on her face.
      </p>

        she appealed while gesturing towards the Northlands. "Was there to pick
        mushrooms he was but never returned, and the very night he left there was these
        great plumes of the vilest, blackest smoke that erupted up from deep in them

        Following the strange woman's directions takes you near on half a day,
        orange wisps of sunset soon teasing the sky as you march. You press on

        night should fall and then pick up your adventure in the morning.

<p class="MsoNormal">
        Sunset is in full swing as you reach the apex of a hill and finally see
        a thick line of ancient trees less than a mile away. So dense is the old

        were enjoying just hours ago. This forest is not only enchanted, but
        those enchantments seem to bend reality itself. A fine adventure must
        surely be ahead!

<p class="MsoNormal">
        You look back towards the hill that you just descended, pondering the
        sudden change in time for just a moment and, when you look to the forest again, the
        trees themselves seem to have moved.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        No longer is there a solid, thick treeline inviting you to clamber over
        roots and forge new paths, but a clear entryway is now right there in

        It feels like you span half the forest in following the wolf, but you never leave this area of melted trees and destruction.
        You assume, then, that you've just been
        heading on a complicated and circling route. Else the forest is more destroyed than you thought, and that is not a prospect to dwell on.

<p class="MsoNormal">
        The wolf pauses above a ledge and carefully climbs down out of your

        of earth and forest.

        And in the cover beneath the arc of that wave... is a nest. The disfigured wolf is there,

        Beyond the bramble bush lies a clearing, with the same thorny foliage

        of that show is some kind of crude wooden shrine. Its base holds a
        shallow black cooking pot, dented and rusted. It must be far, far older
        than you and certainly not food safe. From immediately behind it, large
        planks of roughly cut wood jut out of the earth in a fan shape, but the

        moss all over them.

<p class="MsoNormal">
        And yet, on the shrine, is an amulet. It seems to be made of purest

        Before you can think on what to do, a flurry of feathers and shrill
        squaws descend on the shrine. In a flash, five pitch black crows have
        landed atop the wood with eyes fixated on you and their proud chests
        puffed. They squawk again, and you realise that all five are making the
        noise in unison, voices overlapping and giving the din power.

        The vines are tough and inflexible, more like tree roots really. And,
        you realise, they must have kept squeezing and gripping the dragon long
        after its death given that the dark green tendrils now embrace the bone
        itself rather than there being a gap for flesh now gone. You are more

        by the beast's huge jaws, jagged teeth, and the noxious green smoke
        trailing from the corners of its mouth. The smoke liquidises the soil

        You hear a flurry of buzzing on the path ahead of you, the air

        Before long, the track you follow is split by an immense oak tree, the
        lower branches of which are a mess and noise of flying insects working
        around a huge nest. You know them to be Tar Bees; not deadly, but they

        The light you absorbed is benevolent, and so are you. You blink and, in
        an instant, you are transported to the ground at the head of a truly
        broken area of the wood. And in that desolated area, you see a
        machine-like beast beyond anything you recognise:
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        The first thing you see of the monster is an entire tree held sideways
        by a thin yet impossibly stiff clawed arm. The upper branches of the
        tree are shaking violently up and down, pine needles falling like snow
        as the trunk disappears sideways. You follow the motion and see that it
        is in fact being consumed bit by bit by the brutally bladed rotating maw
        of something entirely alien to you. The body of the monster is
        impressively bulky, with strange chitinous pipes bursting from the back
        of it and spewing the black smoke you've seen so often on your journey
        thus far. You can see why the spirit of the forest was scared: whatever
        this is devours the very woodland itself.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        And, hanging above it on another strange arm, is an unconscious little
        boy in a cage. You would bet good money on it being the one you entered
        this forest to find.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Before it can see you, before it can even try to attack, you raise a
        hand. In that simple motion, the monster bursts into lights and
        disintegrates bit by bit - its glowing dust blowing into the wind. You
        have erased it not just from these woods, but from history. From the
        now, and the then, and the will be. With another wave of your hand, you
        transport the child into his own bed in the far village.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Then, you allow the power to run through you and into the ground. From
        the top of your head, from your fingertips, the energy recedes and
        leaves behind it a sense of calm. Not long after the last traces have
        left you, you see growth in this once dead land. Saplings of every kind
        sprouting from the wood chip strewn floor and shooting skywards,
        generations passing in an instant. Those fast-growing pines are suddenly
        blanketed by instant old growth, for the power you have gifted into the
        land has rejuvenated the forest to its core.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        It was no small feat giving up that kind of power, and the forest will
        not forget it soon. You will have a home here as long as you live, which
        will be decades longer than expected thanks to the last remnants of that
        otherworldly magic inside you. Well done, adventurer.

        tenses. "Right... Alright... Here I go..." she says and, quite suddenly,
        reaches down and snatches the ring. Her knuckles are tight from where
        she grips it, her eyes clenched shut even tighter, but... nothing

        You blink and the world around you changes; you're in a different
        position, stood nearly exactly where the woman had been crouched on

<p class="MsoNormal">
        The rock, as big and immovable as it seemed, is gone. In its place is a
        neatly stacked pile of bones - long bones arranged in stacked squares
        provide the foundation of the pile (likely holding all of the small
        bones within), then the ribcage rests on top, followed by the pelvis,
        and, finally, a human skull to complete the pile. The skull's empty eye
        sockets stare up at you, its golden front tooth glittering in the sun.
        As disturbing as the sight is, the most unnerving part is how perfectly
        clean the bones are. Cleaner than a butcher would have left them,
        sterilised of soft tissue.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        And atop that skull is a simple gold ring with a note beneath that
        states: "DO NOT TOUCH".

        and you know from a glance that this creature is built for little other
        than combat. To balance this immense head, a long tapering tail extends
        out behind it and, in the middle, a massive muscular body joins the two.
        The creature stands on just two legs, powerful thighs and calves perched
        on three toes with claws at the end of each that could rend a person in
        half alone. But the most fearsome aspect of it are its arms: unusually
        long and spindly, and ending in a mass of jagged spines that you realise

        doubt. It rises shakily to its feet and sniffs at the food, then takes a
        few bites and swallows them down. With what remains, it grips the food

        gown of a princess, leaning over that balcony and waving her arms
        wildly. She seems distressed, and trying to get your attention. The

        growing wherever nature saw best fit, and no single tree seems dominant.
        As such, there are more greens than you've ever seen in one place.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        But to the North... the trees are regimented, grown in a strict grid
        pattern. There is also but one species: a quick growing softwood that
        bursts into maturity in a fraction of the time those ancient trees to
        the South do. This is no natural forest but one planned and cultivated.
        It is no wonder the mystic wood is dying...
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        To the East, you see clearings in the regimented growth structure, and
        what looks like trees that have melted at the tip like candle wax. Not
        far beyond that appears to be the source of the black smoke you've seen
        at various points on your adventure.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        West of the mountain, the new growth forest stretches much farther and,
        at its most distant corner, you can see the distinct shape of an ancient
        Colosseum.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Just ahead of you, down the hill to the North, is what looks like a
        great crater. Perhaps the falling star you saw in the night?

        The ground underfoot becomes increasingly coated in flecks of splintered
        wood, and the new growth forest starts thinning out as you progress.
        Where once there were unnaturally grid-aligned trees, now there are
        unnaturally grid-aligned stumps.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You hear the source of this destruction before you see it. This horrible
        whirring, grinding noise which hurts your ears and vibrates your bones.
        And a splintering sound always comes with it, like a thousand woodsmen
        massacring a fallen tree at once. But it is something far worse than

<p class="MsoNormal">
        The first thing you see of the monster is an entire tree held sideways
        by a thin yet impossibly stiff clawed arm. The upper branches of the
        tree are shaking violently up and down, pine needles falling like snow
        as the trunk disappears sideways. Sneaking forward, you can see that it
        is in fact being consumed bit by bit by the brutally bladed rotating maw
        of something entirely alien to you. The body of the monster is
        impressively bulky, with strange chitinous pipes bursting from the back
        of it and spewing the black smoke you've seen so often on your journey
        thus far. You can see why the spirit of the forest was scared: whatever
        this is devours the very woodland itself.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        And, hanging above it on another strange arm, is an unconscious little

      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You step out into the clearing before the beast, staring it down
        defiantly. You do not know if the thing has eyes but it certainly seems
        to regard your existence: it's bladed maw spins, it's pincer claws at
        the air, and fresh belches of awful smoke erupt from it. There are no
        tricks nor workarounds to be used. Just you, and an infernal beast that
        needs to be slain.

        readying yourself to swim. This section of river is likely its widest
        point, but it's also its most still. And you've swam thrice this
        distance before anyway.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Such a seasoned wild swimmer are you that you don't even flinch or wince
        as you step into the cold water, step after step down that natural dirt
        incline. You kick off from the ground when the water reaches about chest
        level and start swimming, throwing your arms with professional precision
        and making incredible pace across the river.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        At a certain point though, about halfway to the other shore, you realise
        that you haven't been making progress for some time. It seems a trick at
        first, a curiosity of the light perhaps, but the longer you swim, the
        more firmly you're sure that you should have reached the other side by
        now. And even then, you swim on for another ten minutes and make no
        progress. Something is very wrong with this river.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You turn and face the shore you embarked from, swimming with all your
        might towards it. Despite your effort, no matter how long you swim for,
        that shore gets no closer either.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You have until your energy runs out to count the blessing you enjoyed in
        life.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Your adventure ends here, when you let the water take you.
      </p>
<h3>621</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        You go to stand but the moment you tense the lithe muscles in your legs
        to move, the stranger grunts and stirs. With the almost unnerving lack
        of fat in the stranger's body, you can see every muscle of his neck grow
        taut and tense as he lifts his head. It's as if his skull weighted a
        thousand pounds with the effort he's having to put in.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        He finally wills himself to look at you, his golden locks falling clear
        of his face. His eyelids seem as heavy as his head, but not for long: he
        spots something behind you and a look of utmost, urgent terror arrests
        him.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        But you don't turn fast enough to see what scared him so.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Turn to
        <strong>229</strong>
        .
      </p>
<h3>622</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        The monster collapses in a heap, it's clawed arm clattering to the
        forest floor and the caged arm following close behind. You spring
        beneath the cage before it strikes the ground and, holding your arms
        aloft, soften the impact. The child inside falls against the bars,
        bruised but alive.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        Like much of this monster, it looks mechanical but is strangely flesh.
        The bars of the cage bleed as you cut the child free, finding that he
        was also kept in place by a leech like appendage travelling from the
        creature and into the young human's leg. Perhaps this great swathe of
        forest that it had destroyed wasn't enough for it. Perhaps its greed
        would have seen it tear it all to the ground, then come for villages and
        towns next.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        But you stopped that. You saved these Mystic Woods, you saved the lost
        child, and this adventure will be written in the annals of your kind's
        history.
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
        This adventure is over, but there are no doubt even greater ones ahead.
        Congratulations.

<h3 id="crow">Crow Amulet Instructions Warning</h3>
<p>Look at the following page only when you have obtained the Crow Amulet in the game world.
</p>

<br><br>


<h3>Crow Amulet</h3>
<p>An ancient artefact signalling that the wearer is a follower of
  the great Goddess of Greed. Those who bear her token and follow
  her teachings gain incredible powers.</p>
  <p>As long as you have 60 or more Gold Pieces on your person, your fur gives way to scales, your fluffy tail becomes long and tapering, and your head contorts into that of a snout. In other words, you take on the form of a humanoid dragon.</p>
  <p>This new shape also brings with it new abilities:</p>
  <p><strong>BREATH ATTACK</strong><br/>
  Once per combat, you may exhale destructive elemental energy at your foe. First, roll against your Prowess to see if the attack is successful. Then do 1D20 / 4 (rounded down) x 2 damage.</p>
  <p><strong>STRONG SCALES</strong><br/>
  Reduce incoming combat damage by 1.</p>
  <p><strong>CLUB TAIL</strong><br/>
  Once per combat, you may retaliate against an enemy attack by striking out with your powerful tail. Deal 1D20 / 4 (rounded down) damage.</p>

<h3 id="flute">Flute Instructions Warning</h3>
<p>Look at the following page only when you have obtained the Flute in the game world.</p>



<br><br>

<h3>Flute</h3>
<p>This flute is a one of a kind, build by a master luthier. Using
  mechanical and magical craft skill, it is capable of playing the
  once thought impossible 'H' note.</p>
<p>More potently, it can cast powerful magic but ONLY on enemies that
  are suitably enraged.</p>
  <p>In order to use this magic, you must spell out a word using the
    available notes and modify the current paragraph's number using
    the below reference, one letter at a time. Do note, not every word
    will have an effect - only those that the master luthier
    programmed in.</p>
    <p>For example, if the current paragraph number were 100, and the
              word was FEED. You would do 100 +19 (F) = 119; 119 - 9 (E) = 110;
              110 - 9 (E) = 101; 101 + 67 (D) = 168. You would then see the
              results of the spell at section 168.</p>
